**Interviewer:** How   would   you   define   success   for   TikTok?   (instrumental music)   Hey,   everyone.   Welcome   back   to   another   Exponent   Product   Management   Mock   Interview.   My   name   is   Kevin   Wei,   and   on   today's   show   we   have   David.   So   before   we   get   started   with   today's   mock   interview,   David,   can   you   just   tell   the   audience   a   little   bit   about   yourself?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   My   name   is   David   Kosnik.   Thanks   for   having   me.   Um,   I'm   currently   a   product   manager   at   Coda,   which   is   an   all-in-one   document   where   you   can   type   and   have   tables   and   data   in   your   team.   Before   that,   um,   I   started   my   own   company   in   the   gaming   space.   Um,   and   prior   to   that,   I   was   a   product   manager   at   Google   and   YouTube.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome.   It's   great   to   have   you.   So   for   today's   question,   I'd   like   to   ask   an   execution   or   metric   style   question.   These   are   typically   asked   to   see   how   you   would   define   metrics   or   define   success.   So   for   today's   question,   how   would   you   define   success   for   TikTok?  
**Candidate:** Great   question.   Um,   do   you   mind   if   I   screen   share   actually,   since   we   don't   have   a   physical   whiteboard   to   work   on   together?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   Feel,   feel   free.  
**Candidate:** Um,   just   have,   have   a   document.   Okay,   thanks.   Of   course,   it   has   to   be   a   Coda   document   'cause   I,   I   work   at   Coda.   It's   so   great.  
**Interviewer:** (laughs)  
**Candidate:** Um,   so   the   question   was,   uh,   how...   The   question   was   how   should   TikTok   measure   success?  
**Interviewer:** Yes.   Yep,   that's   the   question.  
**Candidate:** Um,   cool.   And   do   you   mind   if   I   just   look   up...   I'm   curious,   uh,   how   TikTok   defines   success   for   themself   today.   Do   you   mind   if   I   just   look   at   their   site?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   sure.   We   can   take   a   loo-   a   quick   look,   but   I,   I,   I'm   really   curious   just   to   think   about   what   your   intuition   might   be.  
**Candidate:** Cool.  
**Interviewer:** And   to   give   you   some,   some   background   too,   it's   a   short   form,   um,   video   app,   sort   of   like   YouTube,   um,   but   shorter   form.   The   videos   are   a   few   seconds   long.   There's   a   feed   with   recommended   videos,   and   we   can   work   off   of   these   assumptions.  
**Candidate:** Very   cool.   Uh,   yeah,   I've   used   TikTok   a   bunch,   but   it's   always   fun   to   see   the   description   in,   um,   people's   own   voice.   Um,   so   they   describe   it   as   the   leading   destination   for   short   form   mobile   video.   Our   mission   is   to   inspire   creativity   and   bring   joy.   Um,   so   this   first   part   is   sort   of   describing   the   state   of   the   business   today.   Um,   maybe   this   shouldn't   be   part   of   how   they   measure   success.   Like,   maybe   they,   in   the   future,   want   to   look   beyond   mobile   video   or   beyond   video.   Maybe   they   want   to   have   images   or   text   or   other   forms   of   media   as   well.   Um,   so   I'm   just   gonna   ignore   this   as   a   forward-looking   statement   and   see   that   more   descriptive   is   kind   of   where   we're   at.   Um,   and   so   their   mission   is   to   inspire   creativity   and   bring   joy.   I   think   the   mission's   super   helpful   'cause   it   should   drive   and   connect   with   the,   um,   core   metrics.   Um,   a   lot   of   people   talk   about   a   north   star   metric   as   the   one   key   metric   to   focus   the   company   around,   that   all   the   initiatives   should   drive   up   into   and   try   to   move.   Um,   so   I'm   gonna   focus   on   that.   What's   the   single   metric   I   would   pick?   In   reality,   of   course,   every   team   will   have   more   actionable   direct   metrics,   um,   that   connect   back   to   their,   their   actual   work,   um,   that   they   should   ladder   up.   Um,   so   let's   see.   Our   mission   is   to   inspire   cre-   creativity   and   bring   joy.   Um,   I'm   just   gonna   make   a   quick   table   here   to   have   a   few,   um,   metric   options   that   we   can   talk   through.   Um,   so   I'm   just   gonna   make   this   column   metric.   I   can   add   a   few   as   we're   talking   through   it.   Um,   maybe   a,   a   description   of   what   that   means,   um,   some   comparables   if   there   are   other   companies,   um,   and   maybe   we'll   add   some   more   as   we   get   into   this.   So,   um,   breaking   down   this   mission   al-   even   more,   uh,   inspiring   creativity   and   bringing   joy,   um,   there's   sort   of   two   components   there   that   feel   connected   but   distinct.   Um,   inspiring   creativity   to   me   implies   taking   action.   You   know,   inspiration   is   when   people   see   something   and   then   they   do   something,   and   so   you   could   have   a   metric   around   actions.   Um,   so   an   action   could   be,   uh,   you   know,   liking   or   sharing,   following,   remixing,   um,   any   sort   of   explicit   action   showing   that,   hey,   you   cared   enough   about   this   content,   it   drove   you   to   do   something,   it   inspired   you.   Um,   there's   also   the   piece   around   bringing   joy.   Um,   how   would   you   measure   joy?   There's   a,   a   few   ways   we   could   try   to   get   at   that.   One   is,   um,   through   qualitative   metrics,   like   a   net   promoter   score.   A   net   promoter   score   is,   uh,   uh,   often   a   survey   methodology   where   people   say   how   likely   they   are   to   recommend   a   service   to   a   friend.   Um,   it's   really   helpful   to   get   a   sense   of   how   people   feel   about   things,   which   metrics   might   not   show.   Uh,   but   it's   often   very   hard   to   scale   up   and   get   this   at   a   sort   of   daily   or   super   granular   level.   Um,   let   me...   That   reminds   me.   Let   me   add   a   little   checkbox   here   to   skip   this   option.   So   I   would   definitely   have,   uh,   some   sort   of   net   promoter   score   as   a   qualitative,   um,   quant   signal.   But   it'd   be   hard   to   make   that   the   single   goal   in   my   mind,   um,   so   that   might   be   a   good   secondary   metric.   Um,   so   what   else   could   we   do   in   terms   of   bring   joy?   You   can   imagine   something   that's   around   time   spent.   Um,   so   how   long   are   you   actually   watching   videos?   Um,   so   sort   of   minutes   in   the   app.   Um,   a   comparable   for   this   could   be   YouTube   or   TV.   Uh,   average   American   spends   many   hours   a   day   on   TV,   and   so   the   argument   for   this   is   while   we're   bringing   joy,   uh,   people   are   voting   with   their   feet.   And   so   if   you're   enjoying   it,   you're   still   watching   it,   clearly   by   spending   more   time   you're   enjoying   it.   Um,   but   maybe   I'll   add   another   column   here   for   sort   of   risks.   The   challenge   with   time   spent   is   how   high   quality   is   the   time?   If   we're   shooting   for   joy   as   our   goal,   uh,   you   can   imagine   spending   a   lot   of   time   but   not   really   enjoying   it.   Um,   sort   of,   you   know,   low   quality   content   or   just-...   not   connecting   with   it.   Uh,   some   people   might   feel   this   way   about   s-   watching   TV   sometimes.   You   have   it   on   in   the   background,   you   don't   really   care   about   it.   Um,   cool.   Let's,   I'm   just   gonna   keep   going   for   a   bit.   Uh,   does   this   make   sense   so   far?   Any   thoughts   or   questions?   Otherwise,   I'll   keep,   um,   having   some   options,   uh,   getting   spelled   out   before   we   converge   on   one.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   this   is   a   good   start.   I'll   just   challenge   you   to   maybe   come   up   with   one   or   two   more   metric   options.  
**Candidate:** Cool.   Yeah,   sounds   good.   So,   um,   maybe   another   version   of   voting   with   your   feet   beyond   time   spent   is   frequency.   Um,   actually   thinking   about,   about   frequency   a   little   more,   there   might   be   two   versions   of   frequency.   So   one   is,   uh,   daily   active   users,   um,   so   did,   did   you   come   today?   And   another   might   be,   uh,   number   of   sessions,   oops,   um,   sessions   per   day.   Um,   so   the   distinction   between   these   is,   uh,   you   know,   daily   active   users   is   a   sort   of   toothbrush   test.   You   would   get   a   point   if   you   came   for,   you   know,   10   seconds   in   the   morning.   Um,   that's   equally   valuable   as   someone   who   came   for   10   hours   all   day   long.   Um,   and   I   think   the,   the   case   for   this,   let's   say,   um,   let's   take   this   from   the   viewer's   perspective   first   maybe   on   like   what   the   benefit   is   of   this   metric.   Um,   the   case   for   this   for   daily   active   users   is   like,   this   is   really   habit-forming.   Um,   so   it's   something   you   connect   with.   So   if   you   come   back   every   day,   regardless   of   how   long   it   is,   it's   clearly   something,   um,   that   is   inspiring   you   to   action   of   coming   back.   It's   something   you   care   enough   to   go   to   do   consistently.   Um,   and   then   the   fifth   option   here,   which   is   sessions   per   day,   is   a   sort   of   variation   on   daily   active   users.   It   could   be   that   I   check   in   three   times   a   day,   that   would   be   three   times   more   valuable.   Um,   and   this   one,   um,   so   sort   of   how   many   unique   times   you   open   the   app   each   day.   A   comparable   for   this   one   might   be   Twitter,   um,   where   Twitter   is   all   about   freshness.   Um,   and   so   you   come   back   to   see   exactly   what's   happening   or   trending   right   now.   Um,   I   think   a   benefit   of   this   one   is   you,   you   really   have   a   sort   of   wired-in,   uh,   habit,   but   it   also   might   be   hard   if   you're   optimizing   for   this   to,   um,   get   as   wide   a   base.   So   if   we   pick   this,   will   we   have   a   lower   base?   Um,   can   we   reasonably   expect   to   target,   uh,   you   know,   many   billions   of   people   coming   many   times   a   day?   Uh,   whereas   for   DAUs   I   could   imagine   maybe   it's   easier   to   hit,   you   know,   a   billion   users   who   come   once   a   day.   Um,   and   actually   thinking   about   these   a   bit,   there's   sort   of   a   sliding   scale   between   these,   uh,   or   with   frequency   in   general.   Obviously   you   have-  
**Interviewer:** So   actually,   let   me   ask   you   a   question   here.   So-  
**Candidate:** Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** ...   when   it   comes   to   TikTok,   can   you   spell   out   who   the   different   users   are?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   great   question.   Um,   I   think   there's   a   range   of   different   users.   We   could   try   to   flush   this   out   here   as   well.   Um,   user   types.   Uh,   one   way   you   could   cut   it   is   by,   by   demographic.   Um,   another   is   by   usage   pattern.   Um,   there's   a   lot   of,   a   lot   of   different   permutations   for   this.   Um,   so   maybe   I'll   just   add   a,   a   quick   type   here.   So   this   is   a   sort   of   demographic   or   usage,   let's   just   call   it   behavior.   Um,   so,   uh,   my   perception   is   TikTok   very   much   came   up   through   sort   of   teens,   which   is   a,   a   demographic.   The,   also   the   common   usage   behavior   is,   uh,   from   my   perspec-   perception,   not   having   seen   the   metrics,   obviously   I'd   want   to   clarify   this,   um,   with   real   data,   but   is,   uh,   lots   of   short   sessions.   Um,   and   so   you   have   behavior   where,   um,   you're   looking   for,   uh,   something   funny   or   to   pass   the   time,   or   you   have   a,   um,   topic   you're   interested   in.   Um,   I   think   a   related   but   slightly   different   behavior   is   where   you   follow   someone,   and   so   I   come   for   a   creator.   Um,   and   so   it   might   be   I,   I   found   them   on   TikTok   or   I   found   them   elsewhere,   they   just   make   amazing   content.   They're   like   a   YouTube   star   to   me   or   a   movie   star   or   they're   the   TikTok   star,   and   this   is   the   place   I   go   to   get   updates   about   them.   Um,   which   is   different   than   being   interested   in   a   topic   like   knitting   or   baking   and   just   looking   to   find   cool   content   around   that,   or   comedy.   Um-  
**Interviewer:** So   z-   zooming   out,   thinking   a   little   bit   more   broadly,   I   think,   um,   when   we   talk   about   people   on   TikTok,   there's   people   who   are   coming   to   consume   content,   there's   people   who   are   coming   to   create   content,   and   maybe   there's   people   who   are   coming   to   advertise,   like   businesses,   right?   Um,   so   wha-   when   it   comes   to   these   sort   of   broader   categories,   I,   I   think   like   the,   the,   um,   what   you've   done   here   in   this   table   is,   is   great,   but   I'm,   I'm   wondering   if   you   think   more   broadly,   what,   like   who   should   we   really   be   focusing   on   first   and   how   that   might   influence   which   North   Star   metric   you   might   pick?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   it's   a   great   question.   Um,   I   think   there   are,   those   are   the   three   right   audiences.   There's   sort   of   an   implied   fourth   audience,   which   is   TikTok   itself,   which   might   benefit   differently,   uh,   depending   on   these   metrics.   Uh,   I   think   the   viewer   and   the   creator   really   go   hand   in   hand.   Without   content   people   are   making   on   the   platform,   what   is   there   to   view?   Um,   I   think   traditionally   at   a   product   like   TikTok,   uh,   we're   more   comfortable   with   advertiser   being   a   lagging   indicator,   where   if   consumption   and   growth   is   strong,   there'll   be   eyeballs,   there'll   be   ways   to   monetize   those   eyeballs.   Um,   and   so   I   would   really   think   about   this   loop   working   for   both   and   not   wanting   to   pick   one   at   the   expense   of   the   other.   Um,   maybe   to   make   it   concrete,   we   could   talk   about   two   metrics   of   time   spent   and   sessions   per   day   as   sort   of   extreme   differing   points   in   the   spectrum.   Would   that   be   helpful?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   Or   maybe   you   can   list   out   some   metric   options   for   creators   and   for   viewers,   and   then   we   can   go   from   there.
**Candidate:** I   see.   So   you're   saying   if   we   wanted   to   optimize   for   creators,   what   would   the   metric   be?  
**Interviewer:** Uh,   yeah.   Or,   or   for   viewers.   Um,   it's   really   up   to   you.   You're   the   PM,   and   I'm   wondering   how   you   might   justify   that.  
**Candidate:** Gotcha.   Um,   yeah.   So   maybe   to,   to   focus   on   the   viewer,   viewer   one   to   start,   um,   you   know,   we   talked   about   a   few   different   options   here   from   actions,   um,   to   time   spent,   DAU   sessions,   and   frequency.   Um,   I'm   just   gonna   say   for   now,   let's   skip   actions.   I   think   it's   the   one   that's,   it's   sort   of   second   order   removed   from,   um,   the   actual   core,   uh,   viewing   experience   of   watching   and   consuming   content.   So   for   viewers,   uh,   first   we're   gonna   focus   on,   um,   time   spent,   DAU,   or,   or,   or   sessions   per   day.   And   I'll   just   drill   into   time   spent   and   sessions   per   day   as   sort   of   interesting   different   extremes.   Um,   I   think   for   viewers,   you   know,   how   many   minutes   you're   watching   is   the   me-   is   the   metric.   So   this   is   basically   the,   the   aversion,   and   the   benefit   of   it   is   you're   voting   with   your   feet,   you're   really   engaging.   Um,   the   downside   is   how   high   quality   is   it?   I   think   for   creators,   um,   the   incentive   with   the   time   spent   system   is   to   make   as   long   content   as   possible.   Um,   to   make   long   content.   Um,   and   so,   you   know,   we   at   YouTube,   uh,   where   I   worked   previously,   one   of   the   reasons   gaming   was   such   a   big   vertical   is   it   was   really   cheap   to   make   really   long   content,   and   our,   all   of   our   recommendation   systems   rewarded   time   spent.   Um,   and   so   I   think   if   you   go   in   that   direction,   you're   incentivizing   content   verticals   where   it's   easy   to   watch   a   lot.   Um,   and   so   this   is   sort   of   telling   creators   what   to   make,   um,   sort   of   implicitly   through   this   metric.   Does   that   make   sense?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   Um,   for   the   sake   of   time   now,   maybe   we   can   prioritize   which   North   Star   metric   you   might   go   after.  
**Candidate:** Gotcha.   Yeah.   So,   um,   maybe   just   to   quickly   talk   about   sessions   per   day,   um,   I   think   the,   the   difference   versus,   um,   you   know,   the   YouTube   case   is   really   extreme.   If   you   think   about   Twitter   where   you're   coming   back   a   lot,   um,   the   incentive   for   the   creator   here   is   to   make   sure   things   frequently.   Um,   like   you   wanna   have   new   content   multiple   times   a   day   that   people   are   coming   back   and   they're   coming   to   view   this   content.   This   will   put   the   pressure   on   creators   to   making   shorter   content   'cause   it's,   it's   more   feasible.   Um,   and   then   I   think   for   viewers,   you're   gonna   have   short   sessions.   Um,   I   think   this   is   a   case   for   like   there   isn't,   there   isn't   necessarily   a   right   or   wrong.   Uh,   you   know,   there's   large   companies   to   be   built   potentially   around   both   of   these.   Uh,   but   the   sessions   per   day   feels   much   more   aligned   with   where   TikTok,   uh,   TikTok's   advantages   are.   You   know,   it   started   on   mobile,   which   is   a   use   case   where   you're   not   sitting   on   your   couch   for   five   hours   in   front   of   a   TV.   It   started   with   short   form   content.   Um,   and   so   I   would   definitely   lean   away   from   time   spent.   Um,   and   then   I   think   between   DAUs   and,   and   sessions   per   day,   if   I   had   to   pick,   this   one   is   even   more   extreme   around   short   content.   I   think   that'd   be   interesting   to,   to   explore   more   deeply.   So   I   would   pick,   uh,   session,   sessions   per   day.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.   Um,   can   you   think   of   some   ...   So   you,   you've   spoken   about   some   risks.   Um,   w-   if   we   have   a   lower   base,   can   you   expand   on   some   of   these   risks   as   to   sessions   per   day   as   being   the   North   Star?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   for   sure.   Um,   I   think   one   of   them   is,   uh,   you   know,   if   you   have   really   short   sessions,   do   you   have   opportunities   to,   um,   introduce   people   to   new   content?   Um,   introducing   to   new   content.   Um,   so   if   people   are   in   a,   a   behavior   loop   where   they   come   for   literally   one   minute   twice   a   day,   how   much   opportunity   do   you   have   to   introduce   them   to   new   content   verticals,   to   new   content   creators?   Um,   on   the   lower   base   piece   in   particular,   I   think   there's   a   question   on,   um,   you   know,   how   accessible   the   content   itself   is.   Um,   if   you   have   really   short,   uh,   potentially   really   niche   content,   um,   if   you're   driving   all   of   your   recommendation   and   discovery   systems   around   sessions   per   day,   um,   do   you   have   an   incentive   to   have   fewer   people   who   use   the   products,   but   they   use   it   really,   really   deeply   versus   many   more   people,   but   they   use   it   shallow,   shallowly?   And   so   if   you   pick   this   metric,   um,   by   itself,   which   is   just   total   sessions   a   day,   I   think   it's   likely   much   easier   to   achieve   this   through,   um,   a   smaller,   really   dedicated   power   user   base   than   a   really   broad   base.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.   So,   so   I   don't   currently   work   at   TikTok,   but   let's   say   that   I   do   and   we're   looking   at,   and,   you   know,   let's   say   that   we're   partnered   on   this   task   and   I'm   the   data   analyst   and   I'm   looking   at   the   data   that   we   have   at   TikTok.   And   I   can   tell   you   like,   "Hey,   um,   David,   you're   the   PM   on   my   team.   It   looks   like   our   users   are,   even   though   this   is   a   short   form   mobile   video   app,   it   looks   like   our   users   are   coming   for   longer   sessions.   Maybe   they're   spending   three   hours   per   day   on   TikTok."   Does   this   change   the   North   Star   that   you've   picked?  
**Candidate:** I   think   there's   an   interesting   ques   ...   So   just   to   make   sure   i   got   that.   Um,   users   are   coming   for   many   hours   a   day.   Should   that   change   our   party,   right?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   And   I   think   this   just   changes   some   of   the   previous   assumptions   that   we   had,   right?   So   let's   assume   that   I'm   the   data   analyst,   I'm   looking   at   our   data,   and   this   is   what   we   have   now.  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   it's   a   good   question.   Um,   I   think   there's   a,   there's   a   question   on   strategy   of   even   if   sessions   per   day   was   our   target,   it's   possible   the   way   to   get   there   would   be   to   optimize   within   a   session   for   time   spent.   Um,   it's   a   little   counterintuitive,   but   it   might   be   the   case.   It's   a   hypothesis   that   we   could   try   to   test   or   validate   through   data,   um,   that   whenever   you   come,   the   best   thing   to   do   to   make   you   come   back   more   times   later   today   is   actually   to   get   you   to   watch   longer.   And   so   there's   a   world   where   this   is   actually   a   perfectly   healthy   leading   indicator   of   coming   back   more   frequently.   Um,   and   that   there's   actually   not   a   trade-off   between,   um,   time   spent   and   sessions.   Um,   so   I   think   that'd   be   like   an   open   question   is......   maybe   this   is   just   a   really   powerful   secondary   driver,   um,   that   feeds   up   into   time   spent.   Um,   I   think   maybe   another   question   is,   um,   "Is   this   a   highly   related   driver   with   sessions   per   day?"   I   think   another   question   is,   like,   how   does,   um,   content,   um,   changing   to   reflect   current   user   behavior?   For   example,   if   creators   understand   that   there's   a   lot   of   long   sessions,   are   they   building   really   long   movies   or   stories   or   shows   that   happen   to   be   split   up   into   smaller   chunks   but   are   designed   to   be   watched   together?   And   I   think   that's   where,   um,   you   know,   the   other   part   of   the   ecosystem   might   be   starting   to   move,   and   it   might   shape   what's   possible,   where   if   you   run   into   a   piece   of   content,   but   it   really   expects   you   to   watch   it   for   20   minutes,   it's   actually   just   a   show   that's   broken   up,   um,   you   know,   how   accessible   is   that   if   you're   just   coming   for   10   seconds?  
**Interviewer:** Cool.   Um,   great.   Was   there   anything   else   you   wanted   to   add   before   we   wrap   up   the   mock   interview?  
**Candidate:** Um,   we   didn't   really   touch   on   the   advertiser   at   all.   I   mean,   I   think   there's   another   implied   North   Star   here,   which   is   revenue,   um,   which   is,   you   know,   a   totally   reasonable   thing   to   optimize   for   and   where,   uh,   you   know,   what   pays   the   bills.   Um,   but   maybe   that's   for   another   interview   question   if   we're   out   of   time.  
**Interviewer:** For   sure.   Well,   thanks   so   much   for   this   awesome   mock   interview,   David.   I'm   wondering   if   you   could   just   provide   some   self-reflection   on   how   you   might,   things   you   did   well,   things   you   might,   uh,   improve   in?  
**Candidate:** For   sure.   Um,   things   I   did   well,   I   think   I   outlined   the   state   space   pretty   well,   um,   you   know,   having   a   range   of   different   options,   explaining   what   they   were.   Um,   I   think   I   probably   went   too   wide   in   this,   you   know,   it's   a   pretty   big   table   for   the   short   amount   of   time,   um,   and   sort   of   had   to   rush   through   towards   the   end   to,   uh,   pick   the   actual   choice,   top   choice   of   the   metric.   Um,   so   I   think   I   could   have   done   a   much   faster   breath,   uh,   you   know,   here   are   10   options,   now   I'm   going   to   drill   into   the   one   I   think   is   best   and   why   and   discuss   counter-metrics   or   other,   um,   options   I   didn't   pick.   So   I   think   that   was   a   time   management   piece   there.   I   think   on   the   user   types,   you're   totally   right   to   call   out   other   audiences.   Um,   I   should   have   done   that   more   explicitly   earlier.   I   think   I   had   even   titled   this   for   viewer   with,   uh,   thinking   in   my   head   I   was   going   to   add   for   creator   or   for   advertiser   later,   and   then,   um,   just   got   sort   of   into   the   weeds   here.   So   I   think   that   was   a   really   good,   um,   call-out.  
**Interviewer:** For   sure.   So   looking   at   my   feedback   that   I   have   here,   I   think   you   did   a   great   job   starting   with   the   mission,   and   I   like   how   you   dissect   it   and   pick   the   most   critical   part   of   their   tagline   or   their   mission   to   focus   on,   which   is   inspiring   creativity   and   bringing   joy.   And   especially   during   these   times   of   COVID,   it's,   uh,   I   think   what   you   did   with   sharing   your   screen,   um,   not   only,   I   guess,   like,   using   Coda   and   showing   off,   like,   how   robust   this,   uh,   document   sharing,   uh,   thing   is.   But,   I   mean,   you   know,   if,   for,   for   the   viewers,   if   you're   just,   if   you're   just   using   something   like   Google   Docs,   that's   perfectly   fine.   And   in   fact,   if   you're   interviewing   for   Google   in   your   virtual   on-site,   they   actually   will   supply   links   to   allow   you   to,   um,   sh-   uh,   type   on   a   Google   Doc.   Um,   so   that's   something   that   you   can   expect.   And   I   also   liked   how   you   checked   in   with   me   a   lot.   You   were   really   engaging,   and   I   can   tell   that,   I   mean,   just   overall,   you   seem   like   a   pleasant   person   to   work   with.   I   think   that's   really   important   to,   uh,   come   across   in   a   PM   interview.   And   you   did   a   great   job   whenever   you   were   listing   your   metrics,   you   gave   some   pros   and   cons   for   some   of   these   metrics.   Um,   my,   my   one   piece   of   feedback   would   be   to   just   focus   more   on   the   users,   um,   because   this   is   a   multi-sited   marketplace   where   it's   not   just   the   viewers,   but   creators   are   also,   and   ad-   advertisers   are   also   a   big   part   of   the   TikTok   ecosystem.   And   with   that   said,   um,   that   concludes   our   mock   interview   today.   And   for   the   viewers,   good   luck   with   your   upcoming   PM   mock   interview.
