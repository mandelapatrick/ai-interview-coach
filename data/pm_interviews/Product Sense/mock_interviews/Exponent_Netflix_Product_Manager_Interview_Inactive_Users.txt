**Interviewer:** 10%   of   Netflix   users   are   inactive.   What   do   you   do?   (instrumental music plays)   Hey,   everyone.   Welcome   back.   Today   we   have   a   product   management   mock   interview   with   Chloe.   And   before   we   get   started,   Chloe,   can   you   tell   the   audience   a   little   bit   about   who   you   are?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   So   hi,   everyone.   My   name   is   Chloe   Nne.   Um,   I'm   about   to   be   an   RPM   at   Facebook,   uh,   in   a   couple   of   months,   so   yeah,   excited   to   be   here.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome.   Love   to   see   it.   So   for   today's   question,   suppose   you're   a   PM   at   Netflix.   You   notice   that   10%   of   Netflix   users   are   inactive.   What   do   you   do?  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Um,   so   the   first   thing   I   would   want   to   do   is,   you   know,   to   just   clarify   a   few   things.   So   do   we   already   have,   like,   a   set   understanding,   um,   on   what   we   consider   inactive,   or   is   that   something   you'd   want   me   to   define   myself?   Like,   are   we   saying,   you   know,   we   haven't   seen   X   amount   of   users,   or   10%   of   users   logging   in,   in   X   amount   of   time?   Or   is   that   something   you'd   want   me   to   just   figure   out?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   if   you   can   figure   that   out,   that'd   be   great.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   great.   Um,   all   righty.   Yeah,   so   that's-   that's   pretty   much   the   only   thing   that   I   would   want   to   clarify   off   the   bat.   Maybe,   maybe   something   else   actually.   So   am   I   assuming   that,   you   know,   I   can   get   information   from   you,   like   your,   like   my   data   science   team,   or,   or   whatever,   I   can   just   get   more   information   from   you   to   kind   of   quantify   the   problem?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   of   course.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   cool.   So,   um,   I'll   think   about   my   structure   for   a   little   bit,   and   then   I'll   hop   right   into   my   answer.   Um,   so   in   terms   of   structure,   I'm   thinking   that   first   I   want   to   get   some   more   information,   kind   of   quantify   the   problem,   right?   If   I   was   a   PM   at   Netflix,   this   is,   uh,   these   are   the   steps   that   I   would   take.   Um,   and   then   I'll   propose   like   a   game   plan   and   evaluate   and   just   think   through,   um,   you   know,   what   a   final,   like,   starting   point   would   be   for   me.   Does   that   sound   good?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   that   sounds   good.  
**Candidate:** Cool.   So   just   to   ground   myself,   uh,   here   a   little   bit,   when   I   think   about   Netflix,   right,   and   if   they're   like   o-   like   what   their   overarching,   um,   mission   would   be,   I   would   say   that,   you   know,   it's   to   keep   users   happy   or   like   entertained,   right?   So   some   like   high   level   objective   could   look   like,   um,   as   a   company   like   Netflix,   we   want   to   maintain   X   number   of   active   users,   um,   you   know,   like   at   a   given   time,   let's   say   like   week   to   week   or   even   monthly,   like   X   number   of   active   users.   And   so,   delving   into   what   I   would   consider   activity,   right,   Netflix   is   pretty   straightforward.   You   kind   of   just   log   in   and   you   watch   content.   So   in   my   head,   I   would   think   as,   I   would   think   activity   to   be,   uh,   you   know,   frequently   logging   in,   uh,   that   could   be,   you   know,   again,   some-   some   time   that   would   make   sense   for   us,   like   frequently   logging   in,   and   then   also   engaging   with   content.   So   when   I   think   about   engagement,   I   think   about,   you   know,   like   rating,   like   up   or   down,   or   maybe   adding,   you   know,   content   to   your   list.   I   know   Netflix   has   that   thing   that's   like,   My   List,   and   you   can   add,   like,   shows   that   you   watch   frequently,   or   movies   that   you,   um,   watch   frequently.   That's   kind   of   what   I'm   thinking   about   for   activity.   Does   that   make   sense?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   So   you've   listed   several   different   things   here,   like   pressing   the   ratings,   the   logging   in   action.   I'm   wondering   if   you   had   to   just   pick   one   activity,   what   would   you   say   is   the   most   critical   for   you   to   define   a   user   as   active?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   that's   a,   that's   a   great   question.   I   think   in   my   head,   I'd   probably   say   that   first   one,   right?   So   like   logging   in,   and   then   like   clicking   or   watching   at   least   one   thing,   right?   So   logging   in   and   then   clicking   on   a   show,   clicking   play,   and   like   watching   it.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.  
**Candidate:** And   that's   kind   of   what   I   would   think   is   like   active,   right?   So   that   action   is   happening,   let's   say,   um,   you   know,   like   week   to   week   or   even   just   over,   over   some   time.   Let's   say   week   to   week.  
**Interviewer:** All   right.   So   just   the,   this   activity   of   logging   in   and   watching   a   show,   10%   of   users   are   not   doing   this.   So   now   we   want   to   know   what   you   would   do.  
**Candidate:** Exactly.   Yeah,   that's   a   great   way   to   kind   of   just   hone   in.   So   10%   of   users   are   not   logging   in   and   they're   not   watching   content.   Why?   Like,   what   would   I   do?   How   would   I   go   about   solving   that?   Okay,   so   to   check   back   in   with   my   little,   like,   plan   that   I   came   up   with,   quantify   the   issue,   propose   game   plan,   and   evaluate,   uh,   we're   still   under   quantifying   the   issue.   So   what   I'd   want   to   do   next   is   kind   of   hypothesize,   right?   Get   some   more   information   and   see   whether   I   can   sort   of   diagnose   the   issue   at   hand.   So   going   through   a   few   things   here,   um,   I   know   that   the   market,   the   streaming   market   is,   is   kind   of   saturated   or   is   heading   towards   saturation.   A   lot   of   people   are   coming   out   with   new,   um,   new   services.   So   I   would   ask   you,   as,   you   know,   my   go-to   person   on   my   team,   um,   do   we...   Are   there   any,   like,   new   streaming   services   that   have   come   up,   um,   recently   or   in   that   same   timeframe   that   we   noticed   the   drop   in   activity?  
**Interviewer:** I've   looked   at   some   reports   and   news   articles,   and   it   seems   like   Disney+   is   pretty   big.   We   definitely   still   have   traditional   competitors   like   Hulu   and,   um,   HBO.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   So   in   my   head   though,   those   maybe   have   been   around   for   at   least   six   months.   So   in   the   past,   um,   let's   say   in   the   past   month,   there   haven't   been   any,   like,   new   people   coming   out   or,   like,   Disney+   or   Hulu   haven't,   like,   changed   their   plans,   like   make   it,   made   it   like   super   cheap   or   anything   like   that?  
**Interviewer:** Not   that   I'm   aware   of.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   cool.   Um,   and   then   have   we   done   anything   differently?   Like,   did   we   switch   around,   you   know,   where   the   play   button   is   or,   uh,   did   we   make   everything   green   on   the   front   screen?   Like,   did   we   change   anything   on   our   end   recently?  
**Interviewer:** The   engineering   team   is   always   shipping   new   things   every   week,   so   it's   kind   of   hard   to   tell,   but   just   overall   there   haven't   been   any   major   feature   changes   or   improvements   or   new   features   shipped.  
**Candidate:** Cool.   So   they   ship   new   things,   so   nothing   like   out   of   the   ordinary   has   happened.  
**Interviewer:** Right.   Yeah.  
**Candidate:** Nice.   All   right.   So   have   we   released,   uh,   any   new   content   lately?   Like   have   we...   I   know   obviously   corona   put,   um,   you   know,   a   stop   in   our   production,   our   regular   production   cycle,   but   have   we,   like,   released   anything   new,   uh,   lately?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   So   with   COVID,   we   have   seen   a   slowdown   in   the   new   content   that's   been   released.  
**Candidate:** All   right,   so   nothing,   nothing   new   lately.Cool.   Um,   and   then   just   a   final   thing,   or   a   final   couple   of   things   I'll   say.   Is   this   happening,   like,   in   all   countries?   Like,   we're   seeing   this   drop,   like,   amongst   all   our   users,   nowhere   in   particular?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   globally.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Globally.   Um,   and   then   a   final   thing.   Are   we   trending   on   Twitter?   Do   we   have   any   bad   PR?   Is   anyone   talking   about   us,   writing   articles?   Have   we   do   something   really   bad   lately?  
**Interviewer:** It's   just   the   s-   typical   memes   about   Netflix.   There   isn't   really   anything   negative   there.  
**Candidate:** Typical   memes,   nothing   negative.   Perfect.   Okay,   so,   so   just   to   recap   the   information   that   we   have   so   far.   Um,   you   know,   aren't,   there   aren't   any   new,   like,   major   streaming   services   that's,   that's,   uh,   come   into   the   market   recently.   So   we   know   of   our   Disney+'s,   our   Hulu's,   or   our   Disney+   and   our   Hulu.   (laughs)   Um,   and   they   haven't   done   anything   radical,   like   they   haven't   made   their   plans   super   cheap   or   anything   like   that.   Uh,   nothing,   like,   new   or   out   of   the   ordinary   on   our   end.   We   obviously,   because   of,   uh,   corona,   haven't   been   releasing   any   new   content.   And   then   thankfully,   we   are   not   trending   on   Twitter   ............................   happened.   Um,   and   then   obviously   we're   seeing   this   drop   all   across   the   board.   Perfect.   Um,   yeah,   so   I   think   now   I   probably   want   to   pivot   into,   um,   proposing   my   game   plan,   right?   If   I   could   conclude,   given   all   the   information   that,   um,   I've   gotten   so   far,   I   think   I'd   probably   conclude   that   our   users   are   just   kind   of   bored.   Um,   you   know,   I'm,   I'm   kind   of   go,   I'm,   I'm   gonna,   um,   hypothes-   ...   well,   not   hypothesis.   I'm   going   to,   um,   center   my   game   plan   around   that   assumption,   that   our   users   are   bored,   um,   and   that's   what   we're   targeting.   That's   the   reason   why   we've   seen   that,   that   drop,   that   10%   drop   in   activity   from   our   users.   Does   that   sound   good   or   is   there   anything   else   you   want   me   to   consider?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   that   sounds   good.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Um,   great.   So   I   think   an   overall   goal   here,   um,   with,   because,   you   know,   we   identified   the   problem   to   be   users   aren't   logging   in   and   watching,   right?   So   our   goal   here   would   be   to   get   users   to   log   in   and   watch.   In   other   words,   get   their   attention.   In   other   words,   spice   it   up,   right?   We   want   our   users   to   be   happy   and   entertained.   So   I've   thought   about   this,   um,   in   a   few   ways,   or   I've   come   up   with   a   few   solutions   of   what   I   would   do   if   I   was   a   PM   at   Netflix.   Um,   the   first   thing   I   think   about   is,   you   know,   along   those   same   lines   of,   like,   getting   our   users'   attention,   um,   I   would   want   to   do   something   like,   like   a   Netflix   Wrapped   or,   like,   a   Netflix   recap.   So   kind   of   similar   to,   um,   what   Spotify   has   done   over   the   past   couple   of   years,   where   users,   you   know,   either   at   the   end   of   the   year   or   we   could   just   kind   of   drop   it   by   surprise,   like,   right   now   given   the   situation   at   hand.   Um,   you   know,   users   get,   like,   a   recap   of,   like,   content   that   they've   engaged   with   in   the   past,   or   like   their   favorite   shows   or   things   that   they   re-watched   a   certain   number   of   times,   um,   you   know,   just   to   get   the   buzz   going.   Um,   a   pro   there   would   be   obviously   leveraging   social   media.   Like,   getting   people   talking   is   always   a   good   thing.   Well,   not   necessarily   always   a   good   thing,   but   we   can   get   their   attention   that   way.   Actually,   a   con   would   be   that   it   could   potentially   backfire.   So   one   thing   that   we   know,   um,   happens   is   that   multiple   people   maybe   use   one,   uh,   Netflix   account.   It's   pretty   common.   And   so   we   could   potentially   have   a   situation   where   we're   like,   "Hey,   this   was   your   favorite   show   and   this   is   what   you   did."   And   it   actually   wasn't   me,   it   was   my   sister   who   has   refused   to   stop   using   my   Netflix   account.   So   that   would   be,   uh,   you   know,   a   potential   con   in   that   case.  
**Interviewer:** So   if   the   problem   here   is   that   people   are   bored   with   the   content,   what   do   you   think   the   goal   for   such   a   Netflix   recap   would   be?   What   would   it   do?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   that's   a   great,   that's   a   great,   um,   question.   So   I   think   in   my   head,   because   we   technically   can't,   like,   go   out   into   the   world   and   interview   however   many,   you   know,   I   wouldn't   say   million,   like,   subscribers,   uh,   we   have   or   like   how   many   are   inactive,   we'd   want   to   sort   of,   like,   get   their   attention,   um,   in   some   way.   And   so   because   I   hypothesize,   or   the,   like,   conclusion   that   I   came   to,   um,   you   know,   my   hunch   was   that   users   were   bored,   I   feel   like   one   thing   that,   um,   you   know,   sort   of   a   recap   or   like   a   wrapped   thing,   uh,   would   do   or   could   potentially   do   is   just   get   them   excited   again.   Like   remind   them   of,   like,   old   content   that   they   used   to   watch   or   like   have   them   watch   them.   Especially   because,   you   know,   you   did   mention   that   we   haven't,   like,   um,   been   putting   out   new   content   recently.   So   it's   very   possible   that   they   may   have   felt   like,   "Oh,   you   know,   I've   bin-   I've   binge   watched   everything   that   I   already,   uh,   used   to   like,   but   there's   that   one   show   that   I   used   to   love,   like,   in   my   sophomore   year   of   high   school   that   I   haven't   been   watching   forever."   So   that's   just   kind   of   some   ways,   like,   bring   them   back   around,   get   them   excited   again   about   their   accounts.   Um,   another   ...   Sorry,   d-   did   that   make   sense?   I'm   kind   of   going   forward.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   it   makes   sense.   I   see   you're   kind   of   th-   trying   to   get   them   to   come   back   through   some   throwback   content.  
**Candidate:** Exactly.   Exactly.   That's   pretty   much   the   point   there.   Um,   yeah,   I   was   gonna   say   one   thing.   Oh,   yeah.   So   one   thing   that   we   could   also   leverage   again,   because,   you   know,   this   would   be   great   for   users   who,   um,   you   know,   have   been   inactive   in   the   sense   that   they   haven't   been   logging   in,   but   maybe   they've   been   users   for   a   long   time.   So   we   have   a,   a   great   idea   of,   like,   what   they   like,   like,   what   they   used   to   watch.   We   have,   like,   a   lot   of   their,   um,   you   know,   previous   history   and   previous   data   that   we   could   leverage.   Um,   so   that's   what   I'm   thinking   about   with   that   first   idea.   And   then   to   go   through   these   really   quickly,   the   next   thing,   uh,   I   would   want   to   do   is   content,   right?   So   this   could   either   be,   um,   new   content   or   r-   reviving   old   content.   And   so   what   I   mean   by   that   is,   like,   we   have   a   reputation   or   we   really   sort   of   developed   a   reputation   of,   like,   canceling   things   after,   like,   a   couple   seasons.   So   in   this   case,   we'd   either   want   to,   um,   you   know,   bring   up   new   content   or,   uh,   maybe   ...   I   don't   know   if   you   can   un-cancel   a   show   or,   like,   bring   back   a   show   that   we   may   have   canceled   recently   or   in   the   past.   And   so   a   pro   here   would   be   obviously   new   stuff,   like   on,   you   know,   if   there's   new   content   being   put   out,   people   love   that.   Um,   another   pro   also   would   be,   uh,   that   we   can   sort   of   leverage   that   fan   base   that   we   may   have   upset,   um,   in   the   past.   So   bringing   back   a   show   that   people   love   that   we   had   to   cancel   for   whatever   reason,   um,   we'd   be   able   to   get,   um,   you   know,   maybe   some   of   those   in-active   users   active   again   or,   and   potentially   even   bring   in   new   users,   um,   which   would   tie   back   to   that   first   thing   I   said,   right?   Like,   maybe   for   us,   our   main,   like,   high-level   goal   is   to   always   have,   like,   X   number   of   users,   like,   active,   you   know,   in   a,   at   a   given   time.   Um,   does   that   make   sense?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   that   makes   sense.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   And   then   so   some   cons   obviously   would   be   corona.   Like,   we   had   mentioned   (laughs)   that   there   was   a   pause   in   our   production   cycle   because   of,   uh,   COVID.   I   know   some,   uh,   uh,   production   companies   are   able   to,   um,   have   been   able   to   start,   um-...   setting   things   back   up   again.   Um,   so   potentially,   we   could   look   into   that,   but   I   think   logistically,   it   would   still   be,   uh,   a   bit   challenging   to,   like,   get,   like,   brand   new   content   in.   Another   thing   is   legally,   I'm   not   sure   what,   like,   bringing   back,   uh,   content   that   had   been   canceled   or,   like,   shows   that   had   been   canceled,   what   that   would   look   like   'cause   there   probably   was   a   reason   why   we   had   to   cancel   them.   Maybe   we   lost   the   rights   or   anything   like   that.   Um,   yeah,   so   just   COVID,   logistics,   uh,   and   then   legal   stuff.   Also,   time,   right?   Producing   new   content   always,   like,   that   takes   time.   So   if   we're   looking   at,   you   know,   to   a   drop   of   10%   of   users   over,   like,   you   know,   whatever   period   we   defined,   then   we   can't,   like,   promise   them,   like,   new   content   in   a   week,   right?   It   will   take   some   time   to,   um,   get   that   up   and   produced.   Okay,   so   the   final   thing   that   I   want   to   look   at   are   new   features.   So   the   first   idea   I   have   under   this   is,   uh,   what   I   want   to   call   the   In   the   Mood   quiz.   And   so   what   that,   how   this   would   work   is   you   log   in.   So,   you   know,   for   the   users   that   are   inactive,   if   we're   able   to   identify   those   specific   users,   you   log   in,   um,   uh,   onto   your   Netflix   and   you're   able   to   sort   of,   like,   do   a   little   quiz,   like,   you   know,   um,   like,   is   this   a   movie   night   or   is   this   just   a,   a   binge   shows   on   your   own   kind   of   night,   right?   And   so   with   that   information,   like   with,   uh,   the   answers   they   give,   we   can   then,   like,   suggest,   like,   "Hey,   why   don't   you   watch   this   show?"   Or,   "Why   don't   you,   like,   re-watch   this   show   that   you,   um,   you   used   to,   used   to   like?"   So   a   pro   here   would   be   giving   people,   like,   an   exciting   way   to   find   new   content,   um,   and   then   obviously   a   con   is   that   it   might   just   be   annoying,   it   might   backfire.   Like,   maybe   people,   like,   log   on   and   they   just   don't   wanna   take   that   quiz.   Hopefully   there'd   be   a   way   to,   like,   X   out   or   something,   but   it   could   still   just   be,   like,   um,   potentially   give   a   dip   in,   in   their   user   experience.   And   then   the   second   thing   and   last   thing   that   I   wanna   look   at   under   those,   like,   new   features,   uh,   the   new   features   idea   is,   um,   so   you   know   how   on   that   page   there   are   those   little,   like,   there   are   all   the   different   rows   of   content.   And   so   there's,   like,   the   first   row   that's,   like,   uh,   trending   right   now,   like,   around   the   world   or   there's,   like,   my   list   and   there's,   you   know,   recently   added   and   stuff   like   that.   And   so   a,   a   row   that   I   would   propose   would   be   something   like,   um,   you   know,   you   used   to   love   this   or,   like,   you   haven't   watched   this   in   a   while.   So   it   would   accomplish   the   same   thing   as,   you   know,   what   we   said   with   the   Netflix   recapping,   just   getting   people   reminded   about   what   they   used   to   love   or,   like,   what   they,   um,   you   know,   what   they   haven't   engaged   with   in   a   while.   And   so   it,   it   would   be   a   great   way   to,   like,   re-engage   people.   Um,   and   then   a   potential   con   is   that   it   just   might   go   unnoticed.   I   know   that   there   are   a   bunch   of   those   shows,   like   Oscar   nominated,   blah,   blah,   blah,   and   then   if   you   don't   scroll   all   the   way   down   you   may   not   see,   um,   you   know,   the,   like,   used   to   love   this,   um,   row   or   whatever   you   want   to   call   it.   (clears throat)   So   to   recap,   we   looked   at   the   Netflix   recap,   no   pun   intended,   um,   new   content   or   reviving   old   content,   so   bringing   back   shows   that   have   been   canceled,   and   then   finally   the   new   features   which   would   be   the   In   the   Mood   quiz   and,   um,   you   know,   You   Used   to   Love   This,   like,   row.   Um,   yeah.   Do   you   have   any,   any   feedback?   Would   you   like   me   to   narrow   down   on   one   that   I   would   probably,   like,   uh,   you   know,   propose   to   my   team,   like,   "Hey,   we   should   do   this   to   get   our   users   active   again?  
**Interviewer:** In   the   beginning,   we   talked   about   how   these   users   are   inactive   and   we   defined   them   as   they're   not   logging   in   and   they're   not   watching   a   show.   So   if   they're   not   logging   in   they   probably   wouldn't   see   those   two   new   features   that   you're   building   no   matter   how   cool   they   are.   I'm   wondering   how   you   might   start   them   and   bring   them   back   to   the   funnel.  
**Candidate:** That's   a   great,   that's   a   great   idea.   So   if   I,   if   I   may,   I   think   what   I   would   do,   um,   is   probably   not   go   with   those   two   features   to   start.   Like,   if,   if   I   had   to   propose,   like,   one   out   of   the,   you   know,   several   different   solutions   that   I   propose,   I   probably   wouldn't   go   with   the   new   features   because   like   you   said,   obviously   if   people   aren't   logging   in   then   they're   not   gonna   see   it   anyway.   Um,   and   again,   because   we're   trying   to   sort   of   maximize,   um,   you   know,   attention,   like,   an,   an   attention   grabbing   solution,   one   that   we   think   that   would,   you   know,   really   get   them   hooked   or   most   users   hooked,   I   think   I   probably   would   lean   into   that   first   one,   so   the   Netflix   recap,   Net-   Netflix   Wrapped   thing.   Um,   and   the   main   reason   for   that   especially,   like   you   said,   our   goal   here   obviously   is   to   get   users   to   watch,   right?   But   before   they   watch   they   have   to   log   in,   and   one   thing   that   I   know,   like,   the   Spotify   Wrapped   thing   did   is,   like,   it,   it   got   a   lot   of   people,   like,   wanting   to   log   in,   right?   Like,   "Hey,   I   want   to   know   what   my   Spotify   Wrapped   says."   So   in   that   same   regard,   if   we're   able   to,   you   know,   drop   this,   it   gets   users   talking,   obviously   again   leveraging   social   media,   everyone's   talking   about   like,   "Hey..."   Either...   And   it   can   be   in   either   a   good   way   or   a   bad   way.   It   could   be   like,   "Hey,   my   Netflix   Wrapped   is,   like,   kind   of   bad."   It   just   gets   people   talking,   gets   everyone   like,   "Hey,   let   me   go   log   into   Netflix.   I   haven't   logged   in   in   a   while.   What's   on   my   Netflix   Wrapped?"   Um,   and   that   just,   like,   gets   them   back   onto,   um,   onto   our   platform   and   then   that   most   likely   will   encourage   them   to   either   watch   something   that   was   in   their   Wrapped   or   like,   "Hey,   I   haven't   scrolled   through   Netflix   in   a   while,   like,   what   haven't   I   watched?"   And   then,   um,   watch   content   and   make   them   happy.   (laughs)   So   yeah,   that's,   that's,   uh,   that's   sort   of   what   I   would   do   if   I   was   a   PM   at   Netflix   and   I   came   across   this,   um,   this   issue.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome.   Um,   just   one   quick   followup   question.   What   are   some   metrics   you   would   use   to   determine   success?  
**Candidate:** Okay.   So   the   metrics   that   I   would,   uh,   look   at.   First   I'd   want   to   look   at,   um,   you   know,   weekly   active,   uh,   subscribers   or   active   users.   So   in   this   case   because   our   initial   problem   is   that   users   aren't   logging   in,   they're   not   active,   I   want   to   see   after   we've   pushed   out,   like,   our   Netflix   Wrapped   or   recap   solution,   um,   our   users,   like,   how   are   they   feeling?   Like,   are   they   coming   back?   Are   they,   are   they   engaging   with   content?   So   I'd   look   over   week   to   week   initially   just   to   get   a   feel   and   make   sure   that   we're,   um,   we're   seeing   that   dip,   like,   even   out   or,   like,   go   back   up   into,   you   know,   users   being   active   again.   Um,   and   then   the,   the   other   thing   that   I   would   look   at   is   if   we're   thinking   of...   I   didn't   really   delve   much   into   what   the   N-   Netflix   recap   would   look   like,   but   say   we   have   a   thing   where   it's   like   here   are   all   the   shows   that   you   watched,   like,   last   year,   right?   And   it   shows   you,   like,   five...   Or   here   are   your   top   five   shows   that   you   watched   last   year,   like,   five   shows   or   whatever.   Of   the   content   that   was,   you   know,   given   to,   say,   you   as,   like,   a,   a   Netflix   user,   here   are   the   five   shows,   I   would   want   to   see,   like,   how   many   of   our   users   went   back   and   actually   engaged   with   the   content   that   we,   uh,   kind   of   highlighted   in   the   recap.   So   this   would   help   us   see,   like,   whether   that   was,   um,   not   only   ef-   effective   in   getting   people   to   log   in,   like,   that   would   be   a   great   way   to   see   that   yes,   they   actually   logged   in,   they   actually,   um,   looked   at   their   recap,   but   we   also   want   to   see   whether   they   went   that   extra   step   and,   like,   watched   or,   like-Um,   you   know,   engage   with   the   content   that   we've   pushed   out   to   them.   And   yeah,   and   so   I'd   probably   look   at   those   hand-in-hand,   um,   initially   after   we   ...   if   we   were   to   go   with   that   solution.  
**Interviewer:** Cool.   And   if   you   had   to   pick   one   as   your   North   Star?  
**Candidate:** North   Star   would   be   the   first   one.   Just   again   seeing,   like,   are   people   ...   have   people   logged   in?   Like,   have   they,   um,   um,   watched   anything?   So   that   would   be   the   weekly   active,   uh,   users   over.   And   I'd   really   monitor   that   metric,   like   over,   you   know,   say   the   first,   like,   three   weeks   after   we   pushed   out   the   Netflix   recap   solution.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome,   Chloe.   So   this   is   awesome   for   our   interview.   We're   done   here,   and   I'm   curious,   before   I   give   you   any   feedback,   if   you   could   give   some   self-reflection.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   So   in   terms   of,   uh,   self-feedback,   I   think   the   first   thing   I'd   probably   do,   um,   is   slow   down.   I   feel   like   I   got   a   little   better   over   time,   but,   you   know,   in   the   beginning,   just   making   sure   that   I'm   kind   of   pacing   myself   and   not   talking   too   quickly.   Um,   I   think   I   did   a   good   job   of   sort   of   checking   in,   although   sometimes,   because   I   was   talking   really   fast,   I   had   to   pause,   like   check   in,   but   that's   also   super   importing   ma-   important.   Making   sure   that   you're,   uh,   kind   of   looped   in   with   me   at   each   point.   Um,   I   think   I   probably   should   have   asked   a   bit   more,   you   know,   clarifying   questions.   Uh,   one   thing   that   I   know   I   should   have   asked   is   like,   is   this   happening   over   a   particular,   uh,   time?   So   I   kind   of   kept   saying   like,   "Oh,   sometimes   l-   like,   we   define,"   or   like,   "We   would   define."   Um,   so   I   probably   should   have   specified   like,   "Hey,   we've   seen   this   drop   like   over   a   month,"   or,   you   know,   "This   just   happened   the   past   day."   Um,   and   then,   yeah,   I   think   my   structure   was   also   kind   of   good,   just   it   was   sort   of   high   level   and   I   found   that   that's   always   best.   And   so   instead   of   going   into   the,   like,   very   detailed,   this   is   what   I'm   going   to   say   and   this   is   what   I'm   going   to   say,   this   is   what   I'm   going   to   say.   Just   kind   of   keep   it   high   level   and   making   sure   that   I,   I   sort   of   check   in   with   you   as   I   go.   Uh,   yeah,   what   did   you,   what   did   you   think?   (laughs)   You   probably   have   a   lot   more   feedback   for   me.   (laughs)  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   Well,   overall,   I   thought   this   was   a   great   mock   interview.   I   loved   how   in   the   beginning   you   stated   the   goal,   which   was   around   the   active   users,   and   throughout   the   entire   interview,   like   two   or   three   times,   you   always   went   back   to   that   goal   and   thought   like,   "Hey,   does   this   feature   help   us   meet   this   goal?"   And   that   was   really,   really   powerful.   And   you   also   had   some   really   creative   solutions   around   like   Spotify   recap   and   taking   inspiration   from   like   some   sort   of   BuzzFeed   quizzes   kind   of,   and   I,   I   really   liked   your   approach   on   how   you   would   tackle   this.   So   like   we,   we   went   through   the   root   cause   pretty   quickly   and   you   were   able   to   identify   the   root   cause,   and   when   we   went   to   do   the,   uh,   solutions,   I   liked   them.   The   one   thing   that   I   would   say   is   just   always   remember   in   the   beginning   we   defined   the   inactive   users   as,   you   know,   they   haven't   logged   in.   So   some   of   those   solutions   might   not   fit.   Um,   maybe   some   of   those   are   longer   term   features   after   we   meet   some   of   the   shorter   term.   And   the   last   piece   of   feedback   I   have   to   give   is   around   your   metrics.   I   think   the   two   you   gave   were   good.   One   was   super   high   level   in   terms   of   are   we   getting   users,   and   the   other   one   was   around   the   engagement   for   the   specific   feature   that   you   described,   which   was   the   recap   feature.   Um,   two   features   or   two   metrics   that   I   would   add   is   one   around   acquisition,   which   is   around   how   many   people   are   coming   in   and   using   this.   Um,   maybe,   you   know,   you're   sending   this   through   push   notifications   or   emails.   Um,   and   then   the   other   one   is   around   retention.   So   if   we   bring   back   a   user,   are   they   a   quality   user?   Do   they   come   back   and   do   they   stay   and   are   they   retained?   Overall,   this   was   a   great   interview.   Thanks.   And   for   the   audience,   good   luck   in   your   upcoming   PM   interview.
