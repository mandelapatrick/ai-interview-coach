**Interviewer:** Why   do   you   think   the   PM   at   Strava   launched   the   ability   to   track   indoor   workouts   on   their   app?   (instrumental music)   Hey,   everyone.   Welcome   back   to   another   Exponent   Product   Management   Mock   Interview.   My   name   is   Kevin   Wei   and   on   today's   show   we   have   Alisa.   And   before   we   get   started,   Alisa,   can   you   just   tell   the   audience   a   little   bit   about   yourself?  
**Candidate:** Hi,   everyone.   My   name   is   Alisa.   I'm   currently   a   PM   at   Grubhub.   Been   here   for   a   little   bit   under   two   years.   And   before   this,   I   used   to   work   at   Walmart   Labs   as   a   PM   there   as   well.  
**Interviewer:** It's   awesome   to   have   you.   So   today   let's   do   a   strategy   question   for   this   mock.   And   these   are   sort   of   questions   that   kind   of   have   you   put   yourself   in   the   shoes   of   another   PM   and   maybe,   uh,   see   why   they're   making   certain   decisions.   So   I'd   like   to   ask   you   this.   Why   do   you   think   the   PM   at   Strava   launched   the   ability   to   track   indoor   workouts   on   their   app?  
**Candidate:** Hmm.   Okay,   cool.   I   am   a   Strava   user   myself,   so   definitely   identify   as   a   user.   Just   give   me   one   second   and   let   me   kind   of   put   together   my   thoughts   a   little   bit.  
**Interviewer:** Sounds   good.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   So,   to   answer   your   question   about   why   the   PM   at   Strava   would   launch   the   indoor   workout   feature,   I   think   I'm   gonna   start   a   little   bit   by   talking   about   what   the   mission   statement   is   for   Strava,   kind   of   what   their   goals   are   as   a   company,   dive   into   what   their   current   state   products   look   like,   uh,   prior   to   this   launch,   and   then   also   talk   about   the   goals   and   hypotheses   of   why   they   would   launch   the,   um,   indoor   workout   feature.   So   does   that   all   sound   good   to   you?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   that   sounds   good.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Awesome.   So   in   terms   of   mission   statement,   um,   Strava   currently   is   a   digital   platform   that   connects   athletes   through   a   online   network   by   providing   the   ability   to   track   their   workouts,   but   mostly   it's   for   outdoor   workouts.   So   I   would   use   Strava   if   I'm   running   outside   or   I'm   biking   outside.   I   don't   typically   use   Strava   or   didn't   know   that   it   had   the   functionality   to,   to   be   honest,   to   track   my   indoor   workouts,   like   if   I'm   running   on   a   treadmill.   And   the   key   piece   around   Strava   is   that   it's   building   a   network   for   athletes   to   kind   of   show   the   distance   in   which   they've   covered   during   their   workout.   So   if   I   ran   two   miles,   then   the   GPS   will   show   that   I   ran   two   miles   and   the   actual,   um,   footprint   of   where   I   ran.   So   that's   kind   of   the   mission   of   Strava,   is   to   create   this   online   network   for   athletes.   Now   touching   in,   upon   the,   the   current   state   of   what   Strava   is,   kind   of   mentioned   this   earlier,   but   it's   mostly   focused   on   outdoor   workouts   so   that   GPS   tracking   capability   is   something   that   definitely   comes   to   mind   when   I   think   of   Strava   versus   something   like,   um,   Apple   Watch.   Apple   Watch   tracks   you,   where   you   move.   They   also   have   the   features   just   to   look   at   on   your,   um,   phone   to   see   where   you've   been,   but   I   definitely   use   Apple   Watch   more   for   an   indoor   type   of   workout   whereas   Strava   de-   identifies   more   as   an   outdoor   type   of,   um,   tracker.   In   terms   of   hypotheses   and   goals,   I   would   think   that   this   was   launched...   Was   it   launched   during   COVID   in   terms   of   the   indoor   workout   feature?  
**Interviewer:** You   can   assume   that,   yeah,   it   was   launched   during   COVID.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Yeah,   that   would   make   sense   because   during   COVID   and   what   I'm   thinking   is   that   this   PM   probably   saw   a   shift   in   data   in   terms   of   user   behavior.   So   during   COVID,   um,   depending   on   where   you   live   and   what   the   weather   is   like,   people   didn't   have   access   to   work   out   outdoors   because   they   couldn't   travel   to   events   or   races   that   sometimes   require   you   to   hop   in   your   car   and   actually   sign   up   for   an   event   and   race   in   certain   areas.   So   people   were   probably   tr-   turning   more   to   indoor   workouts   because   they   were   stuck   at   home   and   didn't   really   have   anywhere   to   go,   didn't   have   gyms   to   go   to   or   anywhere   to   really   travel   to.   So   I   think   the,   the   goal   of   this   product,   um,   was   to   offer   the   ability   to   attract   a   new   user   base   that   is   different   from   their   typical   user   base   which   are   people   who   work   out   outdoors.   So   I   would   assume   that   they   made   an   assumption   where   by   introducing   a   new   feature   that   attracts   a   new   user   base   will   grow   our   daily   active,   active   users   by   X   percent,   maybe   something   like   10%,   just   looking   at   what   their   data   used   to   look   like.   Because   with   COVID,   with   less   accessibility   to   travel   and   work   out   outside,   I'm   assuming   they   saw   a   dip   in   terms   of   their   daily   active   users   because   less   people   were   opening   the   app   and   doing   exercises   on   it.   So   this   o-   new   opportunity   would   then   capture   the   new   user   base   of   people   who   work   out   inside.  
**Interviewer:** Sure.   So   it   sounds   like   you're   saying   that   the   PM   saw   this   shift   in   behavior   from   COVID,   but   also   this   opportunity   to   attract   a   new   cohort   of   users.  
**Candidate:** Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** Um,   I'm   wondering   now,   putting   yourself   again   in   the   shoes   of   this   PM,   how   might   you   measure   success,   uh,   once   you've   launched   this?  
**Candidate:** So   I   talked   a,   a   little   bit   about   this,   um,   in   terms   of   daily   active   users.   I   would   break   this   down   into   primary   KPIs   versus   secondary   KPIs.   So   the   primary   KPI   I'd   be   looking   at   to   measure   success   is   daily   active   users   to   kind   of   measure   engagement,   to   see   once   I   launch   this   new   feature,   how   does   it   compare   to   my   original   data,   which   I'm   calling   the   benchmark   data,   before   the   launch?   So   prerelease   data.   Let's   just   say   that   daily   active   users,   um,   assuming   I   have   some   sort   of   graph   to   look   at   this   from   a   week   by   week   view,   I   see   a,   a   dip   is   what   I   would   assume   with   the   current   feature   set   without   indoor   workouts.   So   that   would   kind   of   give   me   a   benchmark   as   to   how   my   engagement   currently   looks   in   terms   of   people   opening   up   the   app   and   having   some   sort   of   activity.   And   when   I   say   activity,   I'm   talking   about   logging   an   event   which   is   like   re-   going   out   for   a   run   or   seeing   that   your   friend   had   done   an   activity   and   then   pressing   like   on   it   which   is   a   kudo,   um,   in   Strava   language   or   just   opening   up   the   app   because   you   logged   into   it.   So   I   would   count   all   of   those   as   events.   So   seeing   that   that   has   gone   down   a   little   bit,   um,   I   would   assume   that   launching   this   new   feature   which   is   indoor   workouts,   the   hypothesis   is   that   it   would   go   up   because   there's   a   new   type   of   user   and   these   users   are   completely   different   in   terms   of   behavior   and   what   kind   of   workouts   they   engage   with,   um,   from   the   original   user   base.   So   that's   my   primary   KPI.   Um,   I   think   secondary   KPIs   I   would   look   at   sign   up   rate   as   one   and   then   also...Um,   activity   upload   rate   I   think   is   another   one   that's   important.   So   what   I   mean   by   sign-up   rate   is,   um,   the   conversion   of   a   new   user   from   when   they   discover   the   product   to   actually   becoming   a   user.   So   because   this   new   feature   is   targeted   at   a   new   user   base,   that's   why   s-   I   think   sign-up   rate   is   important,   because   everyone   who   signs   up   would   be   brand   new   users   if   they   never   knew   about   this   feature   set.   And   also,   um,   l-   back,   logging   back   in   as   another   metric   to   track   to   see   existing   users   who   came   back   to   the   app   because   of   this   new   feature,   so   kinda   see   if   there's   an   uptick   there.   And   then   another   KPI   which   I   said   is   activ-   activity   upload   rate,   that's   to   kind   of   give   us   a   sense   of   engagement   with   the   app   in   terms   of   actually   using   the   activity   and   the   features   that   are,   um,   available.   So   I   would   wanna   measure,   uh,   what's   the   activity   upload   rate   look   like   right   now   when   there's   only   outdoor,   uh,   tracking   available   versus   once   I   launch   the   indoor   tracking   abilities?   Are   people   activi-   actively,   um,   logging   more   activities?   Are   they   working   out   more?   Are   they   using   the   new   features   more   compared   to   the   original   feature   set?   So   kinda   doing   a   comparison   there   to   see   how   well   this   product   launch   has   gone.  
**Interviewer:** So   I,   I   do   have   another   question   but   I   kinda   wanna   dive   in,   into   a,   a   part   here.   So   I   think   you   mentioned   that   the   main   purpose   of   Strava   is   to   track,   or   originally   the   main   purpose   was   to   track   outdoor   workouts,   is   that   right?  
**Candidate:** The   original,   um,   yeah,   like,   in   terms   of   original   feature   sets,   yes.  
**Interviewer:** So   what   would   you   do   if   post-COVID,   after   COVID,   we   see   that   more   and   more   of   our   users   are   now   tracking   indoor   workouts   and,   and   fewer   are,   are,   are   going   back   to   outdoor   workouts?   What   does   that   say   to   you   and   wh-   what   might   you   do?  
**Candidate:** I   would   say   that's   a,   that's   a   really   good   sign   because   that   actually   means   my   feature   launch   with   the   indoor   app,   uh,   was   so   successful   that   it   overtook   our   original   sort   of,   um,   base   feature   sets   that   we've   had.   So   that's   a   really   interesting   thing   to   track.   It's   definitely   something   I   would   wanna   track   is   everyone's   sort   of,   depending   on   which   region   you're   in   and   what   country   you're   in,   the   situation   of   COVID   is   vastly   different.   So   I   would   monitor   that   in   terms   of,   um,   how   each   region   is   performing.   So   let's   just   say   in   the   US   we   see   that   the   indoor   workout,   um,   features   are   taking   off   really   well,   maybe   even   better   than   our   outdoor   workouts.   But   then   in   a   different   country,   maybe   Europe,   we   see   that,   um,   outdoors,   the   opposite   is   happening.   So   I   think   at   that   point   I   would   shift   my   strategy   a   little   bit.   Maybe   I   would   expand   the   indoor   feature   set   for   the   US   'cause   it   makes   sense   to,   but   maybe   I   wouldn't   invest   in   it   so   much   in   Europe   just   because   the   opposite   is   happening   there.   So   I,   I   think   it   really   depends   on   the   post-release,   um,   data   to   see   how   behavior   per   region   is,   is   kinda   changing.  
**Interviewer:** Interesting.   Okay.   Um,   so   thinking   now,   so   now   that   you've   launched   the   indoor   tracking   feature,   how   might   you   go   about   and   iterate   upon   this?  
**Candidate:** Hmm,   okay.   So   I   think   I   would   need   to   understand   the   feature   a   little   bit   more   in   terms   of   what   it   has.   So   assuming   that   I   am   the   PM,   how   I   would   launch   it   in   terms   of   the   MVP   feature   set   would   just   be   probably   a   few   s-   types   of   workouts   that   I   can   log   that   are   indoor,   um,   types,   so   maybe,   like,   yoga   or   high-intensity   interval   training   or   boxing,   maybe   some   of   the   more   common   types   like   that.   So   maybe   just   a   few   categories.   Let's   say   I   just   launched   five   of   those.   Um,   and   then   if   I   see   that   these   KBIs   are   doing   well   for   the   indoor   app   or   feature   set,   I   would   expand   the   types   of   categories   that   I   would   be   able   to   track   mo-   uh,   monitoring   for.   So   in   terms   of   boxing,   the   calories   that   you   burn,   the   type   of   i-   workout   that   that   is   is   very   different   from,   let's   say,   yoga,   where   it's   a   little   bit   less,   um,   cardio-intensive.   It's,   um,   your   heart   rate   doesn't   go   up   as   much.   I   would   make   that,   the   tracking   different   in   terms   of   what   exactly   I'm   monitoring.  
**Interviewer:** So   wh-   when   you   are   iterating   upon   the,   the   feature,   what's   the   user   group   that   you're   trying   to   target?  
**Candidate:** Um,   the   existing   users   that   already   are   familiar   with   the   app.   So   I   wanna-  
**Interviewer:** So-  
**Candidate:** ...   make   them   more  
**Interviewer:** So   p-   people   who   are   already   doing   boxing   or   already   doing   yoga?  
**Candidate:** Mm-hmm.   Yeah,   the   ones   that   are   already   doing   the   activity   themselves,   because   then   they'll   see   that   these   features   are   continuing   to   reiterate,   continuing   to   get   better.   And   then   once   we   have   some   sort   of   testing   to   be   like,   this   is   actually   making   people   more   sticky,   I   would   expand   the   feature   set   so   that   there's   more   types   of   categories.   So   maybe   there's,   um,   treadmill   running   and   that's,   like,   a   new   c-   category   number   six   in   this.   And   then   continue   to   grow   that   feature   set   in   or-   in   t-   in   order   to   cast   a   wide   net   so   more   and   more   different   types   of   athletes   will   get   on   the   platform.   But   I   think   there   needs   to   be   enough   of   a   reason   to   expand   those   categories,   and   the   reason   to   expand   would   be   because   each   one   has   a   specific   way   of   monitoring   depending   on   what   that   workout   is   meant   to   track   in   terms   of   is   it   heart   rate,   is   it   calories?   Like,   whatever   type   of,   um,   metric   within   the   workout   is   most   important   for   that   type   of   category.  
**Interviewer:** So   if   I   were   to   ask,   um,   what   are   the   top   five   items   now   in   the   backlog,   what   might   that   look   like?  
**Candidate:** Um,   I   would   say   first   one   is   to   double   down   on   our   existing   categories,   so   let's   say   the   five,   to   identify   what   sort   of   specific   metrics   f-   for   those   types   of   workouts   are   most   important   to   hone   in   on   to   en-   ensure   accuracy   and   improve   performance.   Um,   and   then   I   would   also   say   another   one   is   to   expand   the   categories   that,   in   which   we   monitor   for.   So   maybe,   like,   basketball   is   one,   volleyball   is   another   one.   But   what   exactly   are   those   different   categories   that   we   want   to   expand   it   to?   Um,   and   then   I   would   think   another   one   is   to   just   make   sure   that   our,   in   terms   of   quality,   um,   the   usability   of   the   app.   So   when   you're   working   out   indoors,   like,   are   you   holding   the   phone   or   are   you   having   some   sort   of   integration   with   your   Apple   Watch   that   then   tells   Strava   what   your   metrics   are?   Like,   what   does   that   integration   look   like?   I   think   that   is   a   little   bit   harder   to   do   just   because   there   is   integration   with   different,   uh......   platforms   like   Apple   Watch   or   Garmin   or,   um,   Fitbit.   Like,   what   exactly   do   we   want   to   integrate   with?   But   that,   I   think,   is   further   down   the   line   in   terms   of   identifying   which   ones.   I   think   the   easier   one   would   be   to   just   pick   one   and,   and   try   it   out   first   to   see   if   it   works,   maybe   depending   on   market   share.   Let's   say   Apple   Watch   is   the   most   popular   one,   and   the   one   that's   easiest   to   integrate   with.   Try   that   and   then   see   if   there's   any   sort   of,   um,   um,   type   of,   like,   people   picking   it   up   more   so,   and   then   we   will   continue   to   expand   to   different   types   of   integrations.  
**Interviewer:** Do   you   think   a   partnership   with   Apple   Watch   or   an   integration   with   Apple   Watch   at   this   point   makes   sense?   Thinking   about-  
**Candidate:** No.   That   would   be   a   more   future   state.   I   think   until   we,   um,   sort   of   nail   the   quality   and   the   performance,   uh,   performance   of   the   app   itself   and   in   terms   of   the   categories   that   make   sense   to   track,   those   are   the   first   two   I   would   get   out   the   way   first.   And   then   once   it   makes   sense   to   integrate,   we   would   look   into   things   like   Apple   Watch.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.   So   how,   how   might   you   prioritize   this,   this   backlog   that   you've   listed?  
**Candidate:** Um,   so   I   would   look   into,   in   terms   of   benefits   versus   the,   the   cost   of   doing   it.   So   if   something   is...   Let's   just   take   the   first   one,   for   example,   which   is   improving   the   performance   of   tracking,   uh,   let's   say   yoga.   So   what   exactly   are   we   defining   as   accuracy   when   it   comes   to   yoga?   So   once   we   define   that   set   of,   uh,   metrics,   we   can   then   look   into   how   much   does   it   cost   for   our   tech   to   be   able   to   track   this,   and   what   is   the   benefit   of   actually   doing   this   work?   Like,   do   we   think   that   because   accuracy   in   tracking   yoga   has   become   X   percentage   better,   yogis   will   become   Y   percentage   stickier,   therefore   they'll   be   more   loyal   to   our   platform   compared   to   any   other   type   of   platform?   If   we   can   have   them   become   more   sticky   and   then   they   come   back   to   our   app   every   single   day,   that'll   fit   into   our   primary   metric,   which   is,   um,   daily   active   users,   which   is   the   main   thing   that   we   wanna   drive   here.   So   kind   of   making   sure   that   we   connect   what   we   are   doing   now   when   we're   weighing   pros   versus   cons   back   to   our   original   goal,   which   is   continuing   to   have,   um,   daily   active   users   being   of   the   metric   that   we   care   about   the   most.  
**Interviewer:** Cool.   Um,   that's   all   I   had   on   my   side.   So   thanks   again   for   this   awesome   mock   interview,   Elisa.   So,   uh,   I'm   actually   gonna   give   you   just   some   feedback   real   quick   before   I,   I   let   you,   um,   provide   some   self-feedback.   So   I   think   you   did   a   really   good   job   stating   the   mission   and   how   we're   seeing   the   shift   from   outdoor   to   indoor   workouts.   And   you   asked   a   really   critical   follow-up   question   about,   "Hey,   like,   can   I   assume,   uh,   if   this   is   during   COVID   or   not?"   I   think   that's   a   really   good   insight   that   you   had.   Um,   uh,   one   thing   that   I   would   say   is   perhaps,   uh,   be   a   little   bit   more   focused   on   the   user.   I   think   I,   I   had   to   ask   a   follow-up   question   at   some   point,   but,   uh,   proactively   just   diving   deeper   into   the   user.   Uh,   you,   you,   you,   you   did   do   a   good   job   here   where   you   did   talk   about   the   outdoor   users,   um,   but   maybe   I'm   just   being   a   little   nitpicky   here.   And,   um,   the,   the,   the   last   one   is   I,   I   think   the,   the   solutions   that   you   gave   for   how   to   iterate   on   the   feature   were   good,   but   maybe   I   would   challenge   you   to   be,   to,   to   do,   to   maybe   take   one   step   further   and   think   outside   the   box.   Maybe   there's   some,   uh,   VR,   uh,   iterations   we   can   have.   Maybe,   like,   just   think   a   little   bit   outside   the   box.   Like,   it's   okay   to   have   one   that's   maybe   like   a   moonshot.   So   that's   what   I   had,   but   I,   I   think   all   in   all,   it   was   a   great   mock.   So   I'd   love   to   hear   what   sort   of   self-feedback   you   would   give   yourself   here   and   maybe   just   some   tips,   um,   and   advice   for   the   audience   who's   preparing   for   a   mock,   uh,   or   pre-   preparing   for   a   PM   interview.  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   for   sure.   No,   I   totally   agree   with   that   feedback.   I   think   the,   the   roadmap   ques-   roadmap   question   of   what   the   future   iterations   will   look   like,   I   think   the   first   two   that   I   gave,   I   agree   were   more   actionable   and   doable.   The   third   one   with   integration,   there's   so   many   pieces   that   come   with   integration.   It's   just   something   you   would   have   to   really   invest   to   do   and   make   sure   it's   worth   it,   that   that   was   a   little   bit   more   down   the   line   and   didn't   have   as   much,   um,   weight   to   be   considered   earlier   when   the   product   is   still   kind   of   going   through   its   MVP   phase.   So   I   would   say   that   that   one,   uh,   may   not   have   been   the   best   roadmap   idea   to   mention   at   this   point.   That's   probably   more   of   a,   um,   something   to   bring   up   later.   And   in   terms   of,   um,   advice   for   the   audience,   I   think   there   will   always   be   tricky   follow-up   questions,   and   that's   when   it's   the   most   fun,   honestly,   to   kind   of   think   on   your   feet.   And   maybe   I   could   have   done   a   better   job   with   engaging   with   the   interviewer   more   to   make   sure   that   I'm   heading   down   the   right   path   or   if   they   had   any   sort   of   suggestions   to   maybe   head   down   a   different,   um,   solution.   Like,   that   could   have   been   fun   to   do.   So   I   would   probably   do   that   more   next   time.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome.   Thanks   again   for   the   advice,   and   thanks   for   taking   the   time   to   do   this   awesome   mock   PM   interview   with   us.
