**Interviewer:** How   would   you   set   metrics   for   Facebook   Marketplace?   (instrumental music)   Hey,   everyone.   I'm   super   excited   to   be   here   today   with   Aneri   to   do   a   product   management   mock   interview.   In   today's   interview,   we're   gonna   be   focusing   on   a   question   related   to   Facebook   Marketplace.   But   before   we   get   into   the   PM   mock   interview,   Aneri,   could   you   share   a   little   bit   more   about   yourself?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   definitely.   Thanks   for   having   me,   Steven.   Um,   so   Steven   and   I   know   each   other   as   classmates   at   Stanford   GSB.   Um,   before   the   GSB,   I   worked   in   consulting,   and   this   past   summer,   I   just   finished   a   product   management   internship   at   Apple.   Um,   and   after   graduation,   I'll   be   joining   Facebook   as   the   product   manager.   And   the   Exponent   program   was   incredibly   helpful   for   me   as   I   was   prepping   both   the   videos   and   the   course   component   itself.   So,   um,   yeah,   it's,   it's   great   to   be   back   full   circle.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   Um,   and   it's   always   awesome.   At   Exponent,   we   believe   strongly   in   community   and,   uh,   bringing   community   to   the   interview   prep   space,   so   it's   always   awesome   to   have   people   who've   been   through   the   experience   come   back   to   help   others.   Um,   so   thanks   so   much,   Aneri,   for   taking   the   time   and   congrats   again   on   your   successes   in   getting   the   Facebook,   uh,   offer.   Um,   well,   without   further   ado,   I'd   love   to   jump   into   the   actual   interview   question   today.   Um,   and   so   the   interview   question   I'd   love   to   ask   you   is,   how   would   you   set   metrics   for   Facebook   Marketplace?  
**Candidate:** So   I've   used   Marketplace   before   as   a   buyer   and   seller,   but   I   just   wanna   make   sure   that   I   fully   understand   the   product   before   I   get   into   setting   metrics.   Um,   so   Marketplace   is   a   marketplace   that's   two-sided.   Um,   there's   buyers   and   sellers,   and   essentially   it's   a   platform   for   buyers   to   be   able   to   discover,   um,   and   browse   through   items,   and   then   for   sellers,   like   an   everyday   person   to   be   able   to   list   items   and   actually   attract   buyers,   um,   and,   and   sell   the   items.   Is   that...   have   a   good   understanding   of   it?  
**Interviewer:** Yep.   That's   right.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   And,   um,   I   think   that   one   of   the   kinda   key   components   of,   of   Marketplace   is   that   it's,   you   know,   Facebook   has   a   large   commerce   platform.   There's   buy-sell   groups,   there's   now   Facebook   and   Instagram   shops.   And   so   I   think   what   makes   Marketplace   different   in   terms   of   why   this   product   exists   is,   it   allows   anyone   to   be   a   seller.   So   you   don't   need   to   have   actually   a   storefront.   It's,   you   know,   if   I'm   moving   and   I   wanna   sell   all   the   furniture   in   my   house,   I'm   able   to   kinda   quickly   create   a   listing   and   then   attract   an   audience.   Um,   and   then   also   I   think   it,   like,   ties   to   your   local   community,   so   it's,   like,   area...   like   geography-based.   Um,   is   there   anything   else   that   I'm   missing   that   you   think   would   be   important   to   call   out   for   setting   metrics?  
**Interviewer:** That   seems   like   a   good   list   for   now,   and   we   can   always   revisit   it   and   come   back   to   it   if   we   need   to.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   great.   Um,   so   just   to   kinda   share   my   thought   process   of   how   I'm   gonna   think   through   this   problem.   First,   I   just   wanna   think   overall,   why   do   we   have   Marketplace?   Where   does   it   kinda   operate   within   Facebook's   broader   goals?   Um,   and   then   I'll   kinda   start   thinking   about   the   different   users   and   what   are   the   types   of   things   that   we   should   be   measuring.   Um,   and   then   from   there   we   can   kinda   talk   about   what   are   the   metrics   we   should   be   prioritizing   'cause   obviously   there's   thousands   of   things   we   can   measure,   but   there's   probably   a   few   metrics   that   can   help   drive   our   team   towards   its   success.   So   I   wanna   really   focus   on   what   those   key   driving   metrics   are.   Does   that   sound   like   a   good   approach?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   let's   do   it.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   great.   So,   um,   so   first,   just   kind   of   Facebook's   mission   overall   is   to   give   people   the   power   to   create   community   and   bring   the   world   closer   together.   And   Marketplace   really   does   that   by,   I   think,   the   technology   really   kind   of   leans   into   that   community   aspect,   and   it   gives   people   that   power   with   free   and   accessible   tools   and   technology   to,   to,   to   discover   items,   to   buy   items,   and   sell.   Um,   so   I   think   there's   a   lot   of   alignment   with,   with   the   mission,   and   I   think   the   fact   that   it's   accessible   to   everyone,   um,   is   kind   of   a   key   component,   um,   that   really   stays   true   to   the   mission.   Um,   so   I   think   that   the   main   goal   of   Marketplace   is   to   allow   people,   um,   to   empower   buyers   and   sellers   with   technology   that   allows   them   to,   uh,   buy   and   sell   products.   Does   that,   um...   Yeah,   so   I   think...   and,   and   we   can   obviously   hone   in   what   those   actually   mean   and   be   a   little   bit   more   tactical,   but   as,   like,   kind   of   an   overarching   goal,   does   that   kinda   sound   like   the   direction   that   captures,   uh,   what   the   product   is   really   about?  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   And   I   love,   um,   for   folks   watching,   like,   Aneri's   starting   with   the   mission   here,   which   is   really,   really   effective   and   kinda,   like,   bubbling   down   from   that,   and   I...   Yeah,   that   sounds   great.   Let's,   let's   jump   into   it,   and   we   can   talk   more   about,   um,   how   we'd   go   about   that.  
**Candidate:** Awesome.   And   then   in   terms   of,   like,   the,   the   focus   of   the   metrics,   I   really   wanna   focus   on   engagement.   Um,   just   given   the   maturity   of   Marketplace,   I   think   it's   been   around   for...   I've,   I've   been   aware   of   it   for   the   last   three   years,   but   I   think   it's   been   around   for,   um,   at   least   a   few   years   now,   and   so,   um,   I   think   that   right   now,   the   goal   isn't   really   about   getting   more   people   to   use   it,   but   it's   more   about   what,   what   are   the   ways   in   which   they   do   use   it   and   how   are   they   actually   getting   value   out   of   it.   Um,   is   there   anything   else   I   should   keep   in   mind   for   the   goal?  
**Interviewer:** Um,   I   think   that   sounds   good.   I'd   love   to,   at   the   end   of   this   conversation,   have   a   discussion   around   trade-offs   or   how   we'd   think   about   this   goal   as   it   relates   to   some   of   our   other   goals,   like   secondary   goals,   and   maybe   how   they   may   conflict   or   how   we   might   navigate   that.  
**Candidate:** Awesome.   Okay,   great.   Yeah.   So   I   will,   um,   just   to   be   clear,   focus   really   on   engagement   now,   but   then   as   we   talk   about   trade-offs,   um,   really   kind   of   tie   in   other   aspects   and   what   might   we   be   missing   when   we   focus   only   on   engagement   and   not   other   aspects.  
**Interviewer:** Sounds   good.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   great.   So   I'm   gonna   just   take,   um,   a   few   minutes   to   structure   my   thoughts   and   just   to   kind   of...   as   I'm   structuring   it,   the,   the   main   questions   I'm   gonna   be   thinking   about   are,   when   our   product   is   wildly   successful,   like,   what   does   that   actually   look   like?   'Cause   we   wanna   set   metrics   that   help   us   drive   towards   that.   Um,   and   also,   like,   how   are   users   actually   getting,   um,   value   through   it?   And   so   I'm   gonna   kinda   use   those   as   filters,   um,   to   help   me   think   through   what   are   the   main   metrics   we   should   be   tracking.  
**Interviewer:** Great.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Great.   So,   um,   there's...   I   came   up   with   a   few   metrics,   I   wanna   just   kinda   talk   through   them,   and   there's   a   few   buckets   of   the   metrics.   The   first   are   really   just   kind   of   those   core   engagement   metrics   that   would   be   important   to   track,   and,   um,   we'll   just   talk   aloud   through   my   thoughts   on   that.   Um,   but   then   the   second   bucket   are   just   kind   of   thinking   about......   um,   the   ecosystem   at   large,   um,   how   Marketplace   kind   of   plays   in   with   the   other   commerce   initiatives   at   Facebook.   Um,   and   then   kind   of   the   third   is   maybe   what   are   some   of   those   quality   metrics   that   we   need   to   look   at   and   make   sure   that   we're   not   providing   a   bad   experience   for   our   buyers   and   sellers?   Um,   so   I'm   gonna   start   with   the   first   one,   um,   and   really   kind   of   focus   the   metrics   around   the   buyers   and   the   sellers   as   our   two   main   user   groups.   Um,   so   the   first   metric   that   I   am   thinking   about   is   some   sort   of   active   user   metric.   Um,   and   so   I   wanna   kind   of   think   about   what   does   active   (laughs)   mean   and   what   is,   like,   the   cadence?   And   so   I   think   that   with,   with   buyers   and   sellers,   a   weekly   cadence   is,   um,   what   is   probably   most   helpful   to   measure.   I   think   that   there   would   be   a   lot   of   fluctuation   if   we   look   at,   like,   a   daily   active   user   metric   because   maybe   people   shop   more   on   weekends   or   list   items   more   on   weekends,   um,   and   so   I   thi-   and   I   think   it's   just   not,   commerce   is   an   activity   that   people   do   on   a   daily   basis.   So   I   think   a   weekly   active   user   metric,   um,   would   be   really   helpful   for   both   buyers   and   sellers.  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.   Um,   go   ahead,   yeah.  
**Candidate:** I   think   with   that,   the   other   thing   I   just   wanna   make   sure   that   we   really   get   right   is   what   is,   what   does   active   mean   (laughs)   and   what   is,   like,   the   type   of   behavior   we   wanna   be   tracking?   And   I   think,   for   example,   on   the   buyer   side,   there's   a   lot   of   things   we   can   track   such   as,   are   they   just   viewing,   are   they   spending   30   seconds   on   Marketplace?   Are   they   clicking   on   "For   Post"   or   are   they   clicking   on   "For   Post"   and   then   pressing   message   to   the   seller?   And   so   I   really   wanna   work   with   our   data   sciences   team   to   understand   what   are   the   types   of   behaviors   that   really   drive,   uh,   like,   long-term   engagement,   um,   but   I   think   that   right   now,   I'm   leaning   towards   maybe   active   is   you've   clicked,   um,   on   at   least   one   post.   Um,   so   you're   viewing   Marketplace   and   you   click,   like,   details   on   at   least   one   post   for   the   buyer   side.   So   weekly   active   users.  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.   So   to   summarize   that,   a   weekly   active   user   is   someone   who's   clicked   on   a   post,   at   least   one   post   within   a   week's   time   span?  
**Candidate:** Mm-hmm.   Yeah,   and   then   I   think   weekly   active   sellers   as   well,   um,   and,   and   to   be   an   active   seller,   maybe   you've   actually   posted   a   listing,   um,   and,   yeah,   it   was   kind   of   the   caveat   we'd   wanna   really   flush   out   is   that   activity,   maybe   if   90%   of   people   actually   do   that,   maybe   that's   not   actually   a   metric   that's   helpful   to   track,   and   maybe   it's   the   second   step   of   actually   pressing   Message   Seller,   um,   because   you're-  
**Interviewer:** Mm-hmm.  
**Candidate:** ...   interested   in   that   item.  
**Interviewer:** Totally,   that   makes   a   lot   of   sense.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   great.   Um,   so   that's   kind   of   the   first   area.   The   second   one   is,   um,   just   I   actually   have   a   few   clarifying   questions   of   how   Marketplace   works.   So   I   understand   that   there's   a   lot   of   items   that   are   listed.   If   you're   interested   in   it,   you   can   Message   Seller.   Do   we   actually   know   if   the   transaction   occurs   or   how   do   we   track   that?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   that's   a   great   question.   Um,   so   there   are   some   ways   that   we   can   know   that   or   guess   at   that   information   based   on   message,   uh,   history   and   things   like   that.   Uh,   but   we   can   never   know   for   certain   since   it's   an   in-person   interaction.  
**Candidate:** Right.   Yeah,   so   I   think   that   makes   it   really   tricky,   but   when   I   think   about   that   question   of   how   do   users   get   value,   it   really   comes   when   that   transaction   happens,   when   the   sale   happens,   because   I   can   look   through,   like,   five   or   six   items   per   day   and,   you   know,   that   might   show   as   I'm   an   active   user.   But   if   I   don't   actually   purchase   that   sofa,   and   especially   for   the   seller,   if   they're   not   actually   selling   that   sofa,   they   don't   get   value   from   Marketplace.   Um,   so   I   do   think   it   would   be   important   to   try   and   understand   how   do   we   estimate,   um,   those,   um,   those   sales   or   those   transactions.   And   so   I   think   a   potential   proxy   metric   is,   you   know,   maybe   percentage   of,   or   maybe   listings   that   have   at   least   six   back   and   forth   messages,   um,   where   there's   at   least,   you   know,   one   message   on   each   side.   And   so   kind   of   the   way   that   I   imagine   this   going   is   I'm   interested   in   the   sofa,   I   message,   "Is   this   still   available?"   You   respond,   "Yes."   Maybe   there's   some   bargaining   of   price,   and   then   you   give   me   the   address   and   pick   up   instructions.   And   so   I   think   six   is   just   kind   of   a   number   I'll   throw   out   for   now,   but   maybe   if   there's   six   messages,   we're   really,   we're   highly   confident   that   a   sale   has   actually   taken   place.  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.   That   makes   sense.   Um,   just   to   push   you   a   little   further,   are   there   other   ways   on   the   seller   side   that   we   might   be   able   to   know   if   a   sale   has   been   made   or   other   guesses   that   we   can   make   when   we   come   up   with   this   model?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   definitely.   I   think,   um,   if   the   seller   removes   the   item,   um,   or   marks   it   as   sold,   we   have   good   confidence   that   it's   been   sold,   um,   especially   if   we,   if   we   ask   them   how   many   have   been   sold.   I   think   one   risk   with   that   is   if   they're   removing   items   because   they   might   have   sold   it   on   Craigslist   or   on   eBay,   or   they   might   just   be   frustrated   that   they're   not   getting   enough   interest   or   traction.   And   so   I   think   that   maybe   having   a   few   of   these   different   ways   to   track   it   and   maybe   benchmark   them   against   each   other   and   see   how   accurate   is   our,   like,   prediction   in   being   able   to   tell   whether   an   item   has   been   sold.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome.   Yeah,   that's   a   great   point.  
**Candidate:** Cool.   Um,   I   think   the   third   thing,   so   I   mean,   we   have   a   good   sense   of   how   many   people   are   on   our   platform,   whether   the   transaction   happens,   but   I   wanna   know   how   concentrated   it   is.   Is   it,   you   know,   one   buyer   that's   selling   thousands   of   things   per   day   and   then   every,   you   know,   every   other   person   is,   is   not   selling   anything?   So   I'd   wanna   maybe   look   at,   like,   a,   a   distribution   of,   of   buyers   and   sellers   to   see,   like,   number   of   purchases   per   buyer   per   week   and   number   of   sales   per   seller   per   week.   Um,   and   potentially   even   get,   like,   a,   like,   a   P25,   P50,   P90.   So   understanding,   you   know,   the   bottom   25%   of   users,   what's   that   average   and   of   the   median,   and   then,   like,   our   super,   super   active   buyers   and   sellers,   what   is   their   average,   um,   and   understand   that   distribution.  
**Interviewer:** Totally,   that's   a   great,   uh,   thoughtful   point.   Like,   what   are   you   worried   about   in   that   case?   Can   you   tell   me   a   little   bit   more   about   why   you're   looking   at   the   distribution?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   I   think   what,   like,   the   main   motivation   for   this   metric   is   to   make   sure   that   we   actually   have   ...   It,   it   is,   like,   kind   of   fits   our   mission   that   it's   an   every-   a   tool   for   everyday   buyers   and   everyday   sellers   to   use.   And   my   concern   is   that   you   have,   you   know,   professional   shops   maybe   using   this   as,   like,   selling,   like,   new   furniture,   and   then,   like,   someone   like   me   who's,   you   know,   moving   out   of   my   house   and   wants   to   sell   my   furniture   just,   I'm   kind   of,   like   ......   the   buyer   that   really   loses   a   mess   (beep)   and   I   think   we   really   wanna   make   sure   that   we   have,   like,   a   pretty,   like,   even   distribution   throughout,   and   I   think   that   shows   that   our   product   is   fitting   our   mission,   and   that   we   are   attracting   the   right   types   of   buyers   and   sellers.   Um,   and   I   also   think   it   would   help,   like,   later   on   with   like   cohort   analysis   to   understand   where,   um,   where   our   buyers   and   sellers   fall,   and   maybe   we   can   target   these   buyers   and   sellers,   um,   for   different,   like,   advertising   or   different,   like,   new   product   releases   based   off   of   the   cadence   of   their   purchases.  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.  
**Candidate:** Um,   awesome.   I   think   the   other   metric   that   comes   to   mind   for   engagement,   and   I   know   for   a   lot   of   our   other   products   that   Facebook   we   use,   um,   is,   is   time   spent   on   the   platform,   so   like   time   spent   per   user.   Um,   I   think   that   it,   it   kind   of   shows   the   value   that   we   are   bringing   to   the   product   if   people   are   interacting   with   it   a   lot   and   spending   a   lot   of   time.   But   I   think   the   potential   risk   is   maybe   they're   spending   a   lot   of   time   and   they're   not   actually   finding   anything,   so   they're,   like,   searching   for   that   perfect   lamp   and   they're,   like,   spending   a   lot   of   time   and   changing   their   area   a   lot,   but,   um,   can't   actually   find   it.   So   I   think   it's,   like,   an   interesting   thing   to   monitor,   but   maybe   it's   not   a   metric   we   wanna   maximize,   but   just   really   want   to   have   it   so   that   we   are   understanding   if   people   are   actually   using   our   platform   and   for   how   long.  
**Interviewer:** Cool.   Sounds   good.  
**Candidate:** (smacks lips)   So   I   think   those   are   the   main   engagement   ones.   I   think   that   the   other   kind   of   two   retention   ones   that   might   be   important   are   maybe   just,   like,   a   28-day   retention,   um,   for   sellers   and   buyers   to   understand   kind   of   the   average   time   between   purchases,   um,   for   each   listing.   Um,   and   then   maybe   some   sort   of,   like,   stickiness   that   also   falls   under   retention,   so   potentially   weekly   active   users   over   monthly   active   users,   um,   for   both   buyers   and   sellers   to   just   get   a   sense   that   the   content   is   really,   like,   evergreen,   that   people   kinda   keep   coming   back   for   more   content   and   they're   finding   more   and   more   value.   Um,   and   I   think   that   would   give   us   a   good   sense   is   like,   is   this   kind   of   hitting   that   one-time   need   or   are   we   actually   cultivating,   um,   like,   repeat   behavior   from   our   buyers   and   sellers?  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.   Yeah,   that's,   that's   really   helpful.   Um,   well,   it   sounds   like   we've   come   to   a   set   of   metrics   that   we   feel   sort   of   good   about.   I   would   love   to   go   back   to   some   of   that   earlier   question   around,   you   know,   we're   focusing   a   lot   of   engagement   retention.   What   are   we   concerned   about   or   what   are   the   risks   here   with   the   metrics   that   we've   picked?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   I   think   the,   the   risk   is,   is   we're   focusing   on   people   who   are   using   our   product   and   how   they   use   it,   but   we're   not   thinking   about   people   who   aren't   using   our   product.   And,   um,   my   hypothesis   is   that   marketplace   might   do   very   well   in   certain   areas.   So   if   you   have,   like,   a   lot   of   people   around,   like,   a   city,   like,   you   know,   geographically   dense   area,   um,   but   maybe   that   there's   some   regions   or   some   areas   that   it's   not   pop-   that   it's   not   as   popular,   and   so   we're   not   really   capturing   that   with   these   metrics.   Um,   so   in   that   case,   I   would   think   about,   um,   some   awareness,   um,   some   acquisition,   uh,   metrics,   um,   adoption.   And   then   I   think   that's   kind   of   earlier   in   the   funnel.   Um,   and   then   kind   of   later   in   the   funnel,   because   this   is   a   product   that   is   really   mature,   it   might   be   good   to   also   kind   of   track   some   monetization   metrics,   um,   to   make   sure   that   we   are,   um,   kind   of   utilizing   the   user   base   to,   to   be   able   to,   like,   you   know,   target   really   relevant,   um,   ads   and   how   that   behavior,   uh,   works.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   Um,   and,   you   know,   one   more   follow-up   question   sort   of   toward   the   end   of   the   interview,   and   feel   free   to   add   anything   that,   um,   you   wanted   to   share   that   we   may   have   missed   too.   But   why,   why   didn't   we   include   monetization   metrics   as   part   of   this   set?   Like,   what,   what   was   your   reasoning   in,   in   not   including   those?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   I   think,   um,   my   rationale   is   that   if   we   really   can   get   engagement   right,   which   means   that   we're   showing   that   not   only   are   users   using   our   product,   but   that   they're   finding   value   in   it,   then   I   think   monetization   comes   after.   And   so   if   we   can   really   create   this,   like,   really   engaging   experience   for   them,   then   we're   able   to   kind   of   think   about   how   we   bring   ads   into   the   mix   or   how   we   can   potentially   maybe   charge   a   fee   for   the   purchases.   Um,   but   if,   if   that   engagement   part   is   broken,   then   there's   no   point   to   getting   to   monetization.   So   that's   kind   of   the   first   rationale,   um,   for   that.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   That   makes   a   lot   of   sense.   Um,   Aneri,   this   was   awesome.   Like,   is   there   anything   else   we   want,   you   wanna   add   here   in   the   interviewee   mode   before   we   talk   a   little   bit   about   how   this   interview   was,   and   feedback   and   things   like   that?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   I   think   just   the,   um,   the,   the   two   things   I   wanna   touch   on,   those   are   kind   of   the   core   metrics.   But,   um,   first   is,   like,   the   ecosystem.   So,   you   know,   marketplace   plays   a   role   within   Facebook's   overall   commerce   objectives.   And   so   there   are   shops   and,   um,   you   know,   buy-sell   groups   in   a   lot   of   different   places,   even   through   ads   where   people   can   buy   products.   And   so   I'd   wanna   make   sure   that,   you   know,   we're   not   cannibalizing   it   farther   than,   um,   are   kind   of   aligned   with   the   company's   overall   goals.   So   I'd   wanna   kind   of   look   at   a   few,   like,   cohort   metrics   for   cannibalization.   Um,   and   then   the   second   thing   is   I'd   also   wanna   track,   like,   when   it's   a   super,   super   bad   experience.   And   so   things   like,   you   know,   the   seller   is   searching   something   and   there's   no   results   found,   or   looking   at   items   that   are,   like,   blocked   or,   you   know,   sellers   that   are   reported   because   of,   like,   quality   issues   or,   like,   you   know,   threats   or   harassment.   So,   um,   I   think   there's   a,   a   few   buckets   that,   you   know,   if   I   were   the   PM   for   this,   would   kind   of   spend   more   time   kind   of   thinking   through.   But,   um,   just   wanna   share   that,   that   is   also   as   important   to   measure   as   it   is   kind   of   those   good   value   experiences.  
**Interviewer:** Totally,   totally.   Um,   awesome.   Well,   Aneri,   this   was   so   fantastic.   Um,   it   was   so   great   to   see   your   interview   skills,   like,   to   everyone.   And   honestly,   you,   you   crushed   it.   Um,   would   love   to   hear   your   own...   I,   I   wrote   a   bunch   of   notes   about   what   I   thought   you   did   really   effectively,   but   would   love   to   hear   your   own   thoughts,   like,   what   do   you   think   went   well   with   this   interview   or   any   self-reflection   about   it?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   Um,   cool.   Well,   thank   you.   I,   I   thought   that   it   went   pretty   well.   I   think   something   I've   been   working   on   was,   like,   less   is   more   sometimes,   and   it's   probably   more   interesting   to   have   the   discussion   on,   like,   five   or   six   metrics   than   to   list   out   20   or   30   metrics.   Um,   so   that's   something   that   I   tried   to   do,   but   would   love   to   get   your   feedback   on   how   that   worked   versus   being   more   comprehensive   and   just   listing   out,   there's   a   ton   of   things,   um,   you   can   list   out   in   the   funnel.   Um,   I   think   one   thing   I   maybe   could   have   done   better   is   been   more   explicit   on,   like,   buyer   versus   seller.   They   are   the   kind   of   the   two   users   and   been   more   explicit   about   what   are   the   actions   they   take   and   how,   what   are   the   metrics   we   should   measure   for   each.Um,   and   then   I   think   maybe,   like,   being   more   clear   about   that   North   Star   metric.   I   think   the   one   I   would   have   decided   on   is   that   proxy   for   number   of   transactions   of,   like,   the   number   of   listings   that   have   at   least   six   back   and   forth   messages,   um,   and   maybe   just   giving   more,   like,   rationale   of   why   should   we   be   focusing   on   that.   I   think   it,   like,   focuses   on   both   the   buyer   and   seller,   it   kind   of   measures   a   ton   of   things.   But   I   think   just   being   more   clear   and   explicit   with,   um,   the   rationale   for   that,   um,   rather   than   just,   like,   laying   out   six   or   seven   would   have   been   helpful.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   Um,   those   are   all   great   points.   Let   me,   uh,   first   jump   into   what   I   thought   you   did   really   well,   and   I   can   talk   a   little   bit   about   what   you   also   just   mentioned.   Um,   first   of   all,   I   thought   you,   you   did   an   excellent   job   of   checking   in   with   me   throughout   the   interview,   like,   I   was   engaged   as   an   interviewer.   One   of   the   biggest   mistakes   people   make   is   they   think   the   interviewer's   always   paying   attention,   which   is   unfortunately   not   always   the   case.   And   so   you   did   a   great   job   of   engaging   me   and   making   me   a   part   of   it.   Um,   you,   I,   as   I   mentioned   during   the   interview,   you   brought   in   the   mission   really   early   on.   This   is   so   important   and,   you   know,   whether   it's   Facebook   or   any   company,   I   recommend   everyone   read   about   the   mission,   watch   a   keynote   from   the   company   before   you   interview   so   you   can   bring   that   into   your   answers.   So   that   was   really,   really   effective,   I   thought.   Um,   I   liked   th-   the,   the   discussion   on   the   engagement   metrics   was   really   smart,   like,   you   had   a   lot   of   thoughts.   And,   you   know,   there   were   points   where   you   called   out,   "I'm   gonna   decide   weekly   because   of   this,"   or,   "I'm   gonna   explain."   You   kind   of   explained   your   thought   processes   throughout,   which   was   really,   really   effective,   and   I   thought   we   came   to   a   set   of   metrics   that   did   really   make   sense.   Um,   the   one   that,   that   felt   the   hardest   to   me   was   the   time   spent   one,   just   because   there's,   like,   this   ongoing   trend   of   Facebook,   you   know,   sucking   up   all   our   time,   versus,   you   know,   that   clearly   is   a   useful   metric   sometimes.   But   Marketplace   maybe   is   a   more   action-oriented   or   intent-oriented   experience,   and   so   it   might   not   be   good   that   people   are   spending   too   much   time   searching   for   a   product   or   experience.   Um,   and,   you   know,   I,   if   we   had   a   little   bit   more   time,   I   might   have   pushed   you   more   on   that   and   we   might   have   had   a   really   thoughtful   discussion.   Um,   but   I   did,   what   I   did   really   like   that   you   did,   is   you   called   it   out   during,   bringing   it   up.   You,   you,   you   sort   of   said,   "This   is   my   metric,   you   know,   I'm   a   little   unsure   about   some   of   this,"   or,   you   know,   "This   is   maybe   something   we   wanna   watch   out   for."   And   it   did   help   me   ease   my   nerves,   and,   and   that's   almost   why   I   didn't   ask   that   follow-up   question   is   'cause   I   was   like,   okay,   Aneri   already   seems   like   she   kind   of   has   a   sense   of,   of   what's   going   on   here.   Um,   I,   I   thought   the   buyer   versus   seller   comment   that   you   made   about   yourself   would   be   effective,   you   know,   segmenting   those   out   and   thinking   about   those.   It's   just   such   a   clear   marketplace   thing   that   it's   nice   to   kind   of,   like,   segment   them.   Um,   I   think,   you   know,   y-   I   loved   the   focus,   like   I   definitely   don't   think   you   should've   mentioned   more   metrics,   and   I   actually   liked   that   you   mentioned   more   but   you're   like,   "You   know,   I'd   focus   on   these."   I   think   focus   for   the   metrics   questions   are   always   so   important   'cause   it   is   really   easy   to   just   talk   about   all   the   metrics   in   the   world,   you   know?   Like,   you   could   just   keep   talking   about   different,   like   cool   metrics   that   you   can   measure.   Um,   so   I   really   like   that.   I   think,   um,   y-   if   I,   yeah,   and   I   agree   generally   it   does   help   to   pick   one   North   Star   metric   or   one   or   two   North   Star   metrics.   We   had   four,   which   are   a   little   bit   pushing   it.   Like,   um,   it   was   good   overall   and   I   got   a   sense   from   you   about   which   ones   were   important.   But,   um,   yeah,   like,   for   those   who   are   watching,   North   Star   metrics   are   kind   of   like   your   primary   metric   or   the   metric   that   you   would   focus   on.   Um,   so   overall,   but   overall,   Aneri,   this   was   awesome.   You   crushed   it.   Like,   this   is   such   a   great   crisp   example   of   an   interview   for   the   metrics-based   questions,   which   can   be   very   intimidating   to   a   lot   of   product   managers   or   aspiring   product   managers,   um,   because   it,   you   have   to   kind   of   figure   out,   like,   how   you   think   about   these   metrics,   how   you   talk   about   them,   um,   and   it   really   helps   to   have   a   lot   of   practice   and   it,   it   shows   that   you   did   a   lot   of   practice,   so   that's   awesome.   Um,   I   wanna   leave   some   space,   Aneri,   if   you   had   any   reactions,   thoughts,   comments,   or   any   tips   for   folks   watching   before   we   wrap   the   video.  
**Candidate:** Awesome.   Yeah,   thanks,   Stephen,   that   was   really   helpful.   I   do   think   that,   um,   I'm,   I   think   I   can   be   more   clear   with   articulating   the   risks   and   preempting   it,   um,   so   I   think   I,   like,   touched   on   it   but   being   more   clear   with   maybe   even,   like,   I   think   it's   an   interesting   and   engaging   conversation   to   be   like,   "Broader,   do   we   even   want   to   have   a   metric   that   is   gonna   suck   up   people   ti-   people's   time   in   what's   happening   right   now   in   society   of   people   kind   of   questioning   that   time?"   I   think   that   would   have   been   an   interesting   discussion,   so   maybe   opening   the   door   for   some   of   those.   Um,   and   I   think,   uh,   yeah,   so   I   mean,   I   think   the   feedback,   it,   it   all   makes   a   lot   of   sense,   um,   and   definitely   honing   on   one   North   Star   metric   I,   I   highly   recommend,   and,   um,   think   that   that's   really   important.   Um,   I   think   in   terms   of   general   tips,   I   think   that   there,   there   becomes   a   point   when   you're   kind   of   like   studying   where   you,   like,   you   kind   of   understand   the   concepts,   um,   like,   you,   like,   you   know   that   there's   all   these   concepts   that   are   available,   and   then   when   you   really   understand   them   and   truly   understand   how   they   relate.   And   so,   um,   what's   been   really   helpful   for   me   is   really   just,   like,   look   at   any   product   that   you   interact   with,   whether   it   be   digital   or   physical,   and   really   think   about,   like,   what   would   an   awareness   metric   look   like   for   this?   What   would   an   acquisition   metric   look   like?   What   are   the   engagement   metrics?   Um,   and   really   when   you   can   take   those,   like,   textbook   concepts   that   Exponent   does   a   really   great   job   of   explaining   and   then   bring   it   to   your   real   world,   um,   I   think   it   starts   to,   like,   sink   in,   um,   and   then   you   kind   of   get   this,   like,   new   level   of   understanding.   So,   that   is   my   ƒ   Yeah
