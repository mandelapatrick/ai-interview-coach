**Interviewer:** ...   how   you   would   improve   how   people   find   doctors.   (instrumental music)   Hey,   everyone,   I'm   Kevin   Wei.   I   am   a   product   manager   on   IBM's   data   and   AI   team,   and   today   we   have   a   product   management   mock   interview   with   Eliza.   And   before   we   get   started,   Eliza,   for   the   folks   who   haven't   seen   your   other   videos,   can   you   tell   the   audience   a   little   bit   about   who   you   are?  
**Candidate:** Sure.   Um,   so   my   name's   Eliza,   like   you   said,   and   I   am   a   product   manager,   um,   who's   worked   on...   I'm   excited   about   products   that   help,   um,   students   and,   and   help   empower   people,   um,   in   learning   and   creativity.   I   was   working   as   a   PM   and   then   as   head   of   product   at   a   startup   called   Mentor   Collective.   And   now   I'm   a   student   at   Stanford   Grad   School   of   Business,   and   I   also   work   advising   early-stage   startups   on   product   and   go   to   market   and   all   that   good   stuff.  
**Interviewer:** Perfect.   Thanks   for   coming   back   on   the   show.   And   so   for   today's   question,   um,   I'd   like   to   ask   you   how   you   would   improve   how   people   find   doctors?  
**Candidate:** Absolutely.   Very   cool   question.   Um,   so   before   we   dive   in,   Kevin,   is   it   okay   if   I   ask   you   a   couple   of   clarifying   things?  
**Interviewer:** Of   course.  
**Candidate:** Great,   thanks.   Um,   so   first   of   all,   I   wanna   make   sure   I'm   on   the   same   page   about   what   you   mean   by   doctors.   Are   we   talking   mainly   about   medical   doctors?   Are   we   also   interested   in   mental   health   or   other   types   of,   um,   care   services?  
**Interviewer:** Um,   medical   doctors.  
**Candidate:** Cool.   Okay.   Um,   in   terms   of   location,   are   we   thinking   US-centric,   something   broader,   more   flexible,   or,   or   do   you   have   any,   uh,   additional   guidance   around   that?  
**Interviewer:** We   can   assume   that   this   is   for   the   US   region,   yeah.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   great.   Um,   two...   one   or   two   other   things   that   occur   to   me.   So   finding   a   doctor,   um,   I   think   there's,   like,   sort   of   urgent   care   finding   a   doctor   as   well   as   sort   of   finding   a,   a   doctor   in,   like,   a   less   rushed   emergency   situation.   I'm   inclined   to   focus   on   the   second   one,   but   do   you   have   a,   a   preference   there?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   we   can   do,   like,   a   less   rushed   situation.   I   think   for   a   more   emergency   scenario,   the   patient   would   just   call   911.  
**Candidate:** Yes,   agreed.   That'd   be   a   different,   different   flow.   Um,   and   my   last   thing,   uh,   are   there   any   particular   success   metrics   that   you'd   like   me   to   bear   in   mind,   or   would   you   want   me   to   come   up   with   those   on   my   own?  
**Interviewer:** Uh,   it's   totally   up   to   you.   So   th-   just   assume   that   you're   a   PM   at   a   tech   company   and   this   is   the   question   posed   to   you.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Sounds   good.   Um,   if   it's   okay   with   you,   then   I'm   gonna   take   a   minute   just   to   jot   down   a   few   notes.  
**Interviewer:** Sounds   good.  
**Candidate:** Thanks.   Okay.   So   I   think   I'm   ready   to   dive   in.   Um,   and   I,   I   maybe   would   like   to   start   just   by,   um,   taking   a   step   back   and   kinda   thinking   about   what,   what   the   situation   is.   So   you   just   gave   me   some   helpful   context   in   answer   to   my   question,   so   just   to   kind   of   reiterate.   So   we're   looking   to   help   users   who   are   trying   to   find   a   physician,   someone   that   maybe   will   stick   with   them   for   a   while,   not   an   emergency   doctor,   um,   and   we   wanna   help   them   get   through   the   process,   which   might   involve   figuring   out   who   to   go   to,   who   to,   who   the   possible   doctors   are,   who   do   they   want   to   visit,   how   can   they   schedule,   and   then   making   sure   they   schedule.   Um,   so   when   I   think   about   sort   of   success   metrics,   I   wanna   answer   my   own   question   or   propose   an   answer   to   my   last   question   about   success   metrics   just   to   guide   myself.   Um,   I   think   probably   some   success   metrics   would   be,   number   one,   do   they   book   an   appointment   with   the   doctor?   So   that   feels   like   the   most   immediate   indication   of   success,   is   does   the   patient   find   someone   they   want   to   meet   with,   um,   short   term.   But   then   I   think   there's   also   a   long-term   question   about   was   this   doctor   the   right   one   once   they   met.   Um,   so   maybe   we   could   look   at   something   like   rate   of   second   appointments   or   something   that   measures   rate   of   return   to   that   doctor   the   second   time,   so   we   wanna   maximize,   um,   the   percentage   of   people   who   are   having   one   appointment   and   the   percentage   of   people   who   return   maybe   at   least   once   in   the   following,   say,   two   years,   something   like   that.   So   those   might   be   my   sort   of   quantitative   metrics.   Do   those   kinda   make   sense?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   that   makes   sense.   Sounds   like   you're   focusing   on   engagement   and   retention.  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   I   think   that's,   that's   where   I'm   inclined   to   focus,   and,   and   maybe   I'll...   (laughs)   That   should   lead   me   into   thinking   a   little   bit   about   the   users   here.   Um,   before   I   dive   in,   though,   actually   just   to   give   you   a   sense   of   how   I'm   gonna   roadmap   this,   Kevin,   um,   I   think   I   do   wanna...   so   I   thought   a   little   bit   about   success   metrics,   but   I   wanna   dive   into   users   next,   just   to   make   sure   those   metrics   actually   match   up   against   where   I   wanna   focus   on   the   user   side.   Um,   then   I   wanna   think   about   pain   points   specific   to   whatever   users   we   end   up   focusing   on.   Um,   then   we   can   dive   into   some   potential   solutions   to   help   with   whichever   pain   point,   um,   sticks   out   to   us   as   maybe   the   most   severe   or   the   biggest   opportunity.   Does   that   plan   sound   all   right?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   That   plan   sounds   great.  
**Candidate:** Cool.   Um,   okay.   So   this   is   a   really   interesting   one.   Um,   and   I,   I   mentioned   that   I've,   you   know,   worked   in   education,   and   I   think   health   is   similar   because   there's   often,   like,   a   bunch   of   different   types   of   users   to   think   about.   Um,   and   in   this   case,   I   think   there   are,   like,   maybe   four   user   chunks   that   I   would   consider,   um,   in   terms   of   role,   and   those   are,   um...   The   first   and   most   obvious,   I   think,   is   the   patient,   the   person   who   is   doing   the   finding   of   the   doctor   for   themself.   Um,   but   we   can't,   I   don't   think,   forget   about   the   doctors,   who   are,   like,   an   important   participant   in   this   ecosystem   or   in   this   transaction.   Um,   I   think   those   are   the   two   biggest.   There's   also,   though,   I   would   note,   caregivers.   So   there   might   be   someone   who's   looking   for   a   doctor   who's   not   looking   for   themself,   but   maybe   for   their,   their   child   or   for   an   elderly   parent   or   s-   maybe   even   a   friend,   someone   else   in   their   life.   Um,   might   wanna   think   about   them.   And   then   lastly,   and   maybe,   like,   more   tangentially   but   I   think   still   important   is   insurance   companies,   um,   which,   in   my   experience,   p-   play   a   big   role   in   who   a   patient   can   see   in   terms   of   doctors.   So   I   think   we   just   wanna   be   aware   of   them   in   this   ecosystem   as   well.   Um,   so   that's   sort   of   my   high-level   segmentation.   Um,   I   am   most   interested   in   zeroing   in   on   the   patients   and   breaking   them   into   some   behavioral   buckets,   um,   since   I   think...They   have   the   most   choice   in   all   of   this.   I   think   doctors   and   insurance   companies   are,   like,   kind   of   locked   into,   like,   large-scale,   uh,   e-   enterprise   sorts   of   interactions.   Doctors   are   tied   to   doctor's   offices   and   hospitals.   It   just   feels   like   a   much   more   complicated   place   to   insert   a   tool.   Uh,   and   I'm   not   sure   that   the   pain   is   super   severe.   Folks   are   doing   these   jobs,   uh,   they're   getting   paid   to   work   as   a   doctor   and   insurance,   you   know,   person,   and   so   I'm   not   super   inclined   to   think   their   pain   is   as   bad   as   a   patient   who's   searching   around   for   a   doctor.   And   caregivers   are   also   kind   of   complicated   when   you   have   to,   you   know,   deliver   to   a   caregiver,   but   also   to   a-   the   person   being   cared   for.   It's   just,   again,   a   bit   complicated,   and   the   end   user,   that   patient,   may   not   be   the   one...   sort   of   the   same   person   feeling   the   pain   and   making   the   buying   decision.   So   again,   a   little   more   complex.   So   I   think   we   can   make   the   biggest   bang   for   our   buck   on   the   patient   side.   Um,   does   that   make   sense?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   And   what   we're,   um...   Did   you   wanted   to   go   and   slice   this   data   into   different   behavioral   buckets?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   I'd   love   to   do   some,   to   do   some   buckets   on   the   patient.   Um,   so   some   thoughts   on   the   patient.   The,   the   behavioral   slicing   I'd   like   to   do   is   around   why   they're   looking   for   a   doctor.   I   think   that   might   be   a   good   way   for   us   to   get   at   different   s-   clusters   of   pain   points.   Um,   so   why   might   you   be   looking   for   a   doctor?   Um,   one   happened   to   me   very   recently,   which   is   that   you   have   moved   to   a   new   place,   um,   and   you   need   to   find   someone   who's   in   your   new   region.   Um,   something   that   applies   to   people   who   are,   who   have   moved   or   who,   you   know,   for   whatever   reason...   I   think   it's   just   people   who   have   moved.   Um,   a   second   one   might   be,   uh,   you   have   a   sp-   something   has   happened   to   your   health,   like   maybe   you   got   a   diagnosis,   maybe   you   got   an   injury,   uh,   maybe   you   have   some   sort   of   chronic   condition   that   means   that   you   want   to   find   a   doctor.   Maybe   leaning   into   your   health   more   than   you   used   to   or   needing   to   invest   more   in   a   certain   type   of   recurring   care.   Um,   so   like   new   health,   um,   needs   would   be   the   second   one.   Um,   a   third   might   be   maybe   you're   someone   who   has   aged   out   of   pediatric   care,   so   I   think   everybody   kind   of   starts   life   with   a   doctor   that   their   parents   find   for   them.   Um,   but   sometime   around   your   early   20s,   I   think   everyone   kind   of   gets   kicked   out   of   that   pediatrician   and   needs   to   face   the   adult   world   with,   um,   a,   a   different   doctor.   So   that,   that's   something   that   lots   of   folks   go   through.   Um,   and   then   the   fourth   and   final   thing   that   occurs   to   me   is   maybe   you   just   don't   like   your   doctor.   Maybe   you're   just   looking   because   you   don't   like   them   for   whatever   reason,   and   you're   looking   to   make   a   switch   for   that   reason.   Um,   so   I   don't   want   to   forget   about   the   more   mundane,   uh,   buckets   here.   So   just   to,   to   kind   of   recap   what   those   four   were,   um,   people   who   have   moved,   people   who   have   a   specific,   uh,   new   health   condition,   people   who,   uh,   are   finding   their   first   adult   doctor,   and   people   who   don't   like   their   current   doctor  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.  
**Candidate:** Do   those,   those   four   buckets   make   sense   to   you?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   these,   these   make   sense.   Which   one   would   you   prioritize?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   (sighs)   So   they're   all   pretty   interesting.   Um,   some   of...   I'd,   I'd   like   to   prioritize   a   bucket   where   we   can,   again,   make   a   large   impact   and   reach   as   many   users   as   possible.   Um,   so   some   of   these   I   think   are   a   little   bit   more   niche,   and   they   may,   that   may   disqualify   them.   So   the   pacif-   specific   condition   or   injury,   uh,   not   everyone's   going   to   be   receiving,   like,   a   large   chronic   diagnosis.   They're,   you   know,   there's   a   chunk   of   people   there,   but   I   don't   think   it's   everyone,   so   I   might   cross   that   one   off.   Um,   same   goes   for   people   who   don't   like   their   current   doctor.   I   think   inertia   is   pretty   powerful,   so   lots   of   people   just   stick   with   who   they've   got.   You   only   got   to   see   them   once   a   month,   so   I   think   that's   another   not   a   huge   group,   or   not   quite   as   big   as   I'd   like.   Um,   lots   of   people   move,   so   the   group   of   people   moving   to   a   new   location   is   decent,   but   I   think   I'm   gonna   go   with   the   first   adult   doctor   group   because   everybo-   (laughs)   everybody   ages.   I   just   turned   30,   so   I   know   this.   Um,   and   so   I   like   that   because   it,   it   is   the   largest   swath   of   users,   and   I   love   building   for   younger   users   because   you   can   capture   them   early,   um,   you   know,   build   their   connection   to   the   product   for   their   lives.   And   I   think   there's   likely   to   be   significant   pain   for   the   current   generation   of   users   because   I   think,   uh,   doctors'   offices   oft-   often   have   antiquated,   um,   systems,   and   so   there   may   be   particular   pain   that   we   can   really   help.   And   I   think   there's   a   big   mission   impact   too   if   we   can   really   help   young   people,   uh,   build   good   habits   of   going   to   the   doctor.   There's   lots   of,   you   know,   societal   benefits   to   doing   that   as   well,   so   across   the   board,   I   feel   pretty   good   about   that,   uh,   user   group  
**Interviewer:** Sounds   good.  
**Candidate:** Cool.   Um,   so   I'm   gonna   take   another   minute,   Kevin,   if   it's   okay   with   you,   just   to   switch   now   from,   uh,   thinking   about   the   users   to   thinking   about   the   pains.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   go   ahead.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   So   as   I'm   thinking   about   pains,   I   wanna   think   about,   like,   what   solutions   are   there   now.   Um,   if   I   am...   say   I'm   a   20...   I   think   when   I   did   this,   I   was   about   21.   Um,   I'm   a   21-year-old,   I'm   around   the   time   of   finishing   college,   you   know,   the   world   is   exciting   and   scary.   I'm   maybe   I'm   getting   my   first   apartment,   I   maybe   have   my   first   job,   and,   um,   I   wanna   make   sure   that   I'm,   that   I'm   adulting   effectively,   and   one   of   those   things   is,   um,   taking   care   of   my   health.   Um,   so   what   do   I   have   to   do   if   I   want   to   get   that   taken   care   of   in   my   new,   new   home,   maybe   in   my   new   city,   my   new   apartment?   Um,   you   know,   one   easy   one,   uh,   is   that   I   could   just   ask   people.   Um,   that's   like   a   lo-fi   obvious   solution,   um,   but   I   think   for   me   as   a   21-year-old   maybe   in   a   new   place,   it's   not   a   great   solution.   I   think   it   feels,   um,   awkward   maybe   to   a-   Like,   I'm   not   gonna   ask   my   coworkers.   I   just   started   a   job.   That's   sort   of   personal.   Um,   I   don't   really   wanna   ask   my   parents   because   I   feel   also   like   I'm   an   adult   and   I'm   really   trying   to   stand   on   my   own   here,   um,   so   that   doesn't   feel   like   a   fantastic   solution   and   even   if   I   ask   them,   I'm   only   gonna   find   out   about   a   very   small   number   of   doctor's   offices   from   like   just   the   one   that   maybe   my   dad   or   my   mom   or   my,   you   know,   person   who   sits   next   to   me   at   work....   knows   about.   Um,   so   it's   not   a   great   solution.   Um,   on   the   other   hand,   maybe   I'm   gonna   start   googling   and   just   using   the   internet   or   maybe   using   a   tool.   I   think   there's   a   co-   at   least   one   or   two   aggregators   that   exist,   I   think   one   is   ZocDocs,   something   like   that,   in   places   that   just,   like,   pull   together   reviews   about   doctors.   So,   I   could   go   on   there,   I   could   just   pull   up   a   lot   of   tabs,   'cause   I   think   that's   what   I   did   do,   and   just   try   and   parse   all   of   the   information.   Um,   so   this   one   is   good   because   it's   not   awkward.   It's   the,   I'm   very   much   doing   it   on   my   own,   but   on   the   other   hand,   I   think   it's   pretty   overwhelming   and   isolating   that   I'm   trying   to   do   this   scary,   like,   very   important   decision   by   sifting   through   the   internet   by   myself,   and   trying   to   figure   out,   like,   "Are   these   the   right   doctors?   Uh,   do   they   take   my   insurance?   Is,   are   these   good   people?   Can   I   trust   them?"   Et   cetera.   So   it's   not,   it   doesn't   have   the   same   pain   points,   but,   um,   isolating,   um,   uh,   stressful,   and   overwhelming.   Um,   the   other,   the   other   sort   of   existing   solution,   I   think,   is   just   to,   to   maybe,   if   you   haven't   moved,   you   could   just   stick   with   your   doctor's   office,   and   maybe   if   you   had   a   pediatrician,   they   could   just   give   you   a   new,   uh,   doctor,   like,   in   the   same   practice.   I   think   sometimes   doctors   do   that,   where   they   can   just   grandfather   you   over   and   assign   you   to   someone   else.   Um,   that's   much   easier.   It   doesn't   have   the   problems   that   I   mentioned   before,   but   it   doesn't   have   this   empowering   feeling   of   adulthood.   It's   not   like   you're   getting   a   fresh   start   and   really   taking   charge   of,   of   your   life.   Um,   so   I'm,   uh,   that   was...   I   know   that   was,   like,   not   super   structured,   so   just   to   kind   of   re-summarize   some   of   the   pains   that   I   mentioned   there.   Um,   you   know,   there's   a   trade-off   between   either   the   process   is   gonna   be   very   awkward   and   kind   of   limited   if   you   rely   on   word   of   mouth,   or   it's   very   isolating   and   scary,   um,   if   you   do   it   solo   on   the   internet,   or   it's   very,   um,   passive   and,   um,   sort   of,   like,   continuing   of   your   child   life,   um,   if   you   just   kinda   stick   with   whatever   you're   given   by   your   office,   and   it's   keeping   you   in   an   old   location.   If   you've   moved,   maybe   you   have   to   fly   home   to   have   a   doctor's   appointment   or   whatever   it   is.   Um,   so   those   are,   those   are   sort   of   the   pains   that   jump   out   to   me,   but   how   does   that,   um,   sit   with   you,   Kevin?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   So,   it   sounds   like   you   wanna   reduce   the   awkwardness,   so   you   wanna   make   it   easier   to   find   a   doctor,   or   more,   more   seamless,   and   y-   the   isolating   pain   point   is   one   that   you   pointed   out.   And   I   think   third   one   that   I   would   think   about   if,   um,   you   know,   as   your   coworker   who's   helping   you   two   work   on   this   product,   I   would   say   relevance   is   a   big   pain   point.  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   That's   a   really   good   point.   Yeah,   I   agree.   Um,   I   think   there's   something,   there's   something   to,   if   I   were   to,   to   pick   out   of   these,   th-   this   list,   where   would   I   wanna   focus,   the   isolation   and   relevance   feel   most   salient   to   me.   I,   I   suspect   that   the,   like...   I   think   that   most   people   will   try   and   solve   this   through   internet   research.   I   think   the   other   ones   are   less   common.   And   so,   I,   I   think   those   are   the   pain   points   tied   to,   like,   parsing   the   giant   internet   and   all   that's   available   to   you   there.   And   so,   I'd   love   to   think   about,   how   can   we   build   a   product   that   helps   people,   helps   young   people   feel   like   they're   not   alone   in   this   and   helps   them   feel   like   there   are   other   people   here   with   you   who   are   going   down   this   road,   who   are   kind   of   figuring   out   adulthood   just   with   you,   and,   and   you   can   find   doctors   that   are,   um,   that   are,   that   were   useful   to   them   and,   and   will   be   useful   to   you?   So,   just   like   a,   like   a   vision   of   making   people   not   feel   alone,   that's,   I   think,   what,   what   would   perhaps   be   most   effective,   uh,   in   my   mind   as   a,   kind   of   a   North   star.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   Sounds   good.   So,   it   sounds   like   we   wanna   help   younger   folks,   maybe   like   Gen   Z   or   m-   millennial   people   who   are   just   starting   adulthood   and   they're   having   these   problems   around   the   isolating   and,   like,   relevance   around   finding   the   right   doctors.   Um,   so   let's   get   into   solutioning.  
**Candidate:** So   then,   thinking   about   how   might   we   solve   these   pains   of   relevance   and   isolation   for   our,   for   our   Millennial/Gen   Z,   probably   Gen   Z   now,   um,   sort   of   early   20s   folks,   um,   I   think   my   frame   for   thinking   about   this   or   for   coming   up   with   ideas   is   related   to,   like,   what   different   ways...   what,   what   things   make   people   feel   connected?   Like,   what   points   of   connection   are   there   between   our   21-year-old   user   and   the,   um,   the   world   out   there   of   other   people   searching   for   doctors,   and,   like,   what   might   we   use   to   help   them   feel   connected   to   those   folks?   Um,   and   so   the   first   thing   that   occurs   to   me   is   an   institutional   affiliation.   I   know   that   when   I   was   21,   I   was   really   connected   to   the   idea   of   my   alma   mater,   which   I   had   just   left.   I   really   identified   with   my   company,   which   had   just   hired   me,   and   so   I   trusted   those   networks   and   I   felt   a   kinship,   uh,   with   the   people   who   were   part   of   those   networks.   I   thought   they   were   pretty   smart.   I   thought   they   made   pretty   good   decisions.   And   so,   I   wonder   if   we   could   think   about   a   tool   that   partners   with,   uh,   colleges   or   employers   to   provide   a   database   that   is   anonymous,   but   you   know   that   everyone   in   the   database   and,   and   the   people   in   the   database   would   maybe   review   doctors'   offices,   um,   and   you   could   search   through   the   base   and   find   information   that   was,   that   provided,   here's   what   it   was   like   for   this,   you   know,   Cornell   alum   to,   to   visit   this   office.   And   so,   I   would   not   feel   the   awkwardness   of   having   to   c-   call   up   a   friend   and   ask   her,   but   I   would   know   that   I   could   trust   that   review   in   a,   in   a   certain   way.   Um,   there's,   there's   some   questions   about   smaller   companies   and   exactly   how   that   would   work,   which   we   can,   which   you   can   talk   about   if   we   decide   we   wanna   go   down   this   route.   But   I   think   this   has   a   nice   ability   to   kinda   weave   into   onboarding   processes   and   other   things,   and   it's   always,   you   know,   convenient   to   reach   large   groups   of   users   by   partnering   with   an   institution   that   can   reach   them,   um,   more   organically.   So,   that's   one,   one   idea,   is   kind   of   an   affiliation-based   database,   um,   one,   one   suggestion   there.   Another   one,   though,   and   this   is   a   really   personal   problem,   like,   right   trying   to   find   a   doctor   is   deeply   personal,   and   so   I'd   wanna   think   about   not   just,   like,   institutional   affiliation,   but   personal   identity.   Um,   and   so   I   wonder   if   maybe   we   could   think   about   a   sort   of   identity-based   community   for   information   sharing...   about   doctors.   So   for   example,   um,   a   resource   where   you   could   say,   I,   you   know,   identify   as   a   queer   woman   or   as   a,   um,   you   know,   a,   uh,   a   man   of   color   working,   uh,   in   Boston   or   whatever   it   is,   and   just   having   different   subcategories   where   maybe   you   could   go   in   and   learn   from   other   people   with   that   same   affiliation,   maybe   get   questions   answered   and   see   recommendations   tailored   to   a   specific   identity.   And   there's   potential   to   do   different   types   of   engagement   there.   So   I   think   that's   more   of   a,   a   personal   identity   angle.   Um,   doesn't   have   the,   the   pulls   of   like   a   large   institution,   but   I   think   maybe   folks   would   feel   a   stronger   sense   of   obligation   to   those   groups,   which   could   be   nice   for   us   sustaining   engagement   with   the   community   and   having   people   come   back   and   do   things   like   write   reviews.   Um,   so   that   could   be   an   interesting   one.   Um,   and   the   last   thing   that   occurs   to   me,   I'd   like   to   kinda   get   out   of   the,   get   out   of   the   w-   the   sort   of   app   or   web   app   space   and   think   about,   uh,   maybe   location   as   another   way   to   help   people   feel   that   they're   getting   relevant   and,   um,   kind   of   connective   suggestions.   So   I   think   we   might   cons-   like,   I   remember,   um,   well,   I,   so   we   might   consider   something   that,   maybe   an   app   or   something   that   integrates   with   like,   a   smartwatch,   um,   that   tells   you   when   you're   near   a   d-   a   doctor's   office.   So   when   I   got   my   first   doctor,   I   discovered   it   was,   like,   right   down   the   street   from   my   office,   and   I   walked   by   it   from   the   train   every   day,   but   didn't   know   it   was   there.   And   when   I   discovered,   oh,   hey,   it's,   you   know,   right   on,   uh,   Boylston   Street,   I   felt,   like,   safer   and   more   confident,   um,   and   more   connected   to,   to,   to   the   community   and   to   that   doctor's   office.   And   so   I   wonder   if   we   could   provide   th-   that   kind   of   a   nudge,   um,   and   weave   this   doctor   identification   process   a   little   bit   more   into   the   daily   life   of   these   young   people   who   also   are   gonna   be   busy.   That's   not   our   primary   pain   point,   but   just   maybe   a   side   benefit,   that   taking   it   out   of   software   and   a   little   bit   more   into   the,   um,   like   smartwatch   sort   of   thing,   uh,   could,   could   be   nice.   So   those   are   three   suggestions   just   to   kind   of   recap.   Um,   the   affiliation-based,   uh,   database,   number   one.   The   personal   identity   based   community,   number   two.   Um,   and   a   location-based,   um,   nudging,   physical   nudging   system   of   some   kind,   um,   like   on   a   smartwatch   or   on   an   iPhone,   number   three.   Um,   do   those   make   sense  
**Interviewer:** So   when   we're   talking   about   affiliation   with   alma   mater,   most   students   don't   work   in   the   same   city   that   they   graduated   from.   So   how   do   you   think   this   would   work?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   so   I   think   that's   a   potential   downside   to   that   idea.   I   think   it   might...   So   two   different   things.   One,   it   might   work   in   cities   where   people   cluster.   So   there   certainly   are   cities   where   clusters   of   students   go.   This   does   not   cover   everyone.   Um,   but   you   could   sort   of   say,   you   know,   the,   um,   the,   like,   Cal,   Cal   Poly   alumni   in   San   Francisco,   for   example,   or   things   that   are,   like,   somewhat   close   could   work.   Um,   but   there   could   be   solutions   where   maybe   you   rely   more   on   jobs   that   you   might   assume   that   most   people   either   have   a   job   or   went   to,   well,   grad   school,   we   could   think   about   separately,   but   having   jobs   and   then   doing   like,   uh,   uh,   like   groups   of   companies   together.   So   people   who   are   working   in   consulting   in   Boston,   for   example.   So   maybe   industry   specific   could   be   a   way   to   cover,   um,   larger   swaths   of,   of   users.   Or   even   like,   I   worked   at   a   startup   that   came   out   of   Techstars,   which   is   an   incubator,   and   we   were   small   company   and   that   might   not   be   so   good,   but,   um,   all   of   the   Techstars   companies   combined   could   be   a   pretty   large,   um,   large   group   of   people.   So   I   think   it   is   a,   it   is   a   fair   critique   and   maybe   a,   a   reason   to   not   pursue   this   one,   but   I   think   there   are   different   ways   that   you   could   mitigate   that   issue   too.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.   So   for   that   first   solution,   it's   really   thinking   about   how   this   identity   around   their   job   or   alma   mater   would   provide   w-   we'll   partner   with   them   to   have   some   resources   and   database   to   help   them   find   a   doctor,   the   students.  
**Candidate:** And   which   would   de-risk   the   doctor   in   the   eyes   of   these   young   people,   yes,   because   they   know   that   people   with   that   same   affiliation,   they   could   access   reviews   and,   and   learn   from   people   with   their   same   affiliation   of   whether   the   doctor   had   been   good   for   those   folks   or   not-  
**Interviewer:** Okay.  
**Candidate:** ...   assuming   some   relevance   through   that   affiliation   connection.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.   And   for   the   second   idea,   which   is   saying   around   personal   community   or   identity   where,   for   example,   if   you're   a   queer   person   of   color   and   you   want   to   find   a   community   of   people   like   yourself,   like,   is   this   sort   of   like   a   subreddit   or   like   s-   some   sort   of   forum,   or   how   do   you   envision   this?  
**Candidate:** I   would   envision   it,   it   would   be...   So   it   would   be,   to   be   clear,   be   focused   on   finding,   it   would   be   focused   on   medical   care.   And   so   you   would   kind   of   come   in   and   say,   "Here's   my   identity.   I   want   to   access   the   community   about   receiving   medical   care   as,   you   know,   a   queer   woman   of   color."   Uh,   and   then   you'd   be   able   to   get   into   that,   uh,   community   and   maybe   there   would   be,   um...   and   it   would,   you   know,   be   places   where   folks   would   be   chatting   about   different,   maybe   common   questions   that   they   had   and   some   answers,   um,   maybe   different,   uh,   problems   or   critiques   they   had,   the   best,   maybe   the   best   doctors   in   different   regions   for,   um,   for   this.   Um,   maybe   tips   for   visiting   the   doctor,   uh,   you   know,   as   someone   with   this   identity.   You   could   even,   um,   with...   it   could   be   interesting   to   involve   doctors   with   that   identity.   Now   thinking   about   like   some   of   those   other   user   groups,   maybe   spotlighting,   you   know,   a,   a   physician   with   that   identity   and   kind   of   how   they   think   about   it   to   help   maybe   those   people   feel   more   confident   and,   and   better   informed,   not   only   scheduling   appointments,   but   actually   going   into   those   appointments   as   well,   to,   uh,   to   hark   back   to   our   success   metrics   of   getting   them   to   show   up   and   getting   them   to,   to   keep   coming   back.  
**Interviewer:** So   would   it   look   like   some   sort   of   online   forum   board?  
**Candidate:** Um,   yeah.   I   don't   know   if   we...   a,   a   board   to   me   implies   that   it's   like   a,   um,   that   it's   all   text   and   I   think   it   would   be   great   to   make   this   a   little   bit   more   multimedia.   Um,   so   maybe   there's   different,   um,   like   useful   videos   or   other   things.   But   yes,   it   would   be   a,   a   resource   with   information   that   would   be   posted   by,   um,   members   of   the   community,   reviews,   um,   maybe   also   doctors   and,   and   experts   who,   who   could   help,   uh,   these   users   feel   more   confident.
**Interviewer:** Okay.   And   your   third   solution   around   the   smartwatch,   is   this   where   I   w-   if   I'm   walking   around   my   city   and   I   need   a   doctor,   it'll   just   vibrate   and   it'll   tell   me   where   the   nearest   doctor   is?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   And   we'd   wanna   dive   in...   If   we   wanted   to   dive   into   this   one   more   to   think   about   exactly   what   the   nudge   would   be   like,   if   it   would   be   a   vibration,   if   it   would   be   a   push   notification,   I   think   if   we   were   to   go   with   this   one,   we'd   want   to   give   the   user   a   lot   of   feelings   of   control.   So,   um,   I   think   the   risk   with   this   one   is   that   it   feels   invasive,   which   is   not   what   we   wanna   create   in   terms   of   an   impression   when   privacy   is   an   important   consideration   for   health.   But   if   we   could   have,   you   know,   permissions   and   options   at   the   outset   around,   like,   what   kind   of   nudge   do   you   want?   How   often   do   you   want   it?   Do   you   want   us   to   keep   bugging   you   or   not?   You   know,   once   you've   walked   by   a   place,   things   like   that.   But   in,   in   essence,   yes,   it   would   be   a   nudge   when   you   came   geographically   close   to,   uh,   uh,   a   potentially,   uh,   good   fit   doctor's   office.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.   So   in   the   beginning,   we   talked   about   how   we're   focusing   on   engagement   and   retention.   I'm   curious   which   one   you   prioritize.  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   So   I   think   that   my   instinct   would   be   to   focus   on   the   second   one,   the   personal   identity-based   community,   um,   for   a   couple   of   reasons.   Um,   I   think   the   biggest   one   is   that   I   believe   that   when   we   w-   we   go   back   to   the   pain   points   of   relevance   and   isolation,   uh,   personal   identity,   I   think,   is   the   deepest   type   of   relevance.   It   is   the   type   of   affiliation   that   is   most   intrinsic   to   our   users.   Um,   and   so   I   think   it   would   be   most   likely   to   attract   their   attention,   um,   the   e-   and   most   likely   for   them   to   kind   of   build   a   strong   connection   to   it.   Whereas   institutional   affiliation   is,   like,   sort   of   imposed   externally   to   some   extent.   You've   chosen   your   job,   yes,   but,   like,   your   company   is   telling   you   to   use   this   tool.   Um,   and   geography   is   almost   a   little   arbitrary.   Like,   you   happen   to   walk   down   the   street,   um,   it's   not   totally   arbitrary,   but   you   could   potentially   miss   out   on   some   things.   Whereas   I   think   personal   identity,   you're   very   much   getting   at   something   deeper   about   yourself,   and,   um,   I   think   the   user   can   feel   very   much   in   control.   Um,   to   your   question   about   retention,   I   think,   you   know,   we   wanna   keep   people   coming   back   into   this   tool.   I   think   this   one,   far   more   than   the   other   two,   is   likely   to   generate   like   a   flywheel   of   content   coming   back   into   it   and   wisdom   from   the   community   because   people   feel,   and   I   know   this   from   working   as   a   mentor   and   working   on   mentoring   projects,   people   want   to   give   back   to   their   community,   and   they   want   to   support   people   who   are   kind   of   learning   a   thing   that   they've   already   learned.   And   so   there's   a   strong   likelihood   that   if   you,   um,   ask   users   of   this   community,   "Hey,   remember   to   come   back   into   here   and,   uh,   like,   review   the   doctor   after   your   visit,   or   to,   um,   you   know,   tell   us,   did   the   visit   go   well?   Or   to   give   tips   to   the   next   person   who   comes   along,"   I   think   it's   very   likely   that   they   will   be   willing   and   excited   to   do   so.   And   they'll   get   the   positive   vibes   of   maybe   having   likes.   There's   like   a   lot   of   social   functions   you   can   put   in   to   help   make   those   people   feel   good   for   contributing.   Um,   and   in   turn,   to   the   question   of   like,   can   we   help   them   build   a   tool   that   increases   the   likelihood   they   will   return   to   this   same   doctor?   I   think   the   more   that   users   use   a   tool   like   this,   the   better   its   data   will   get.   So   the   better   the   reviews,   the   more   accurate   the   doctor's   reviews   will   be.   The   more   doctor's   reviews   there   will   be,   the   more   offices   and   cities   will   be   covered.   Um,   that   means   the   site   will   make   better   suggestions,   and   that   means   that   the,   um,   likelihood   that,   like,   a   g-   a   good   fit   doctor   is   recommended   also   increases.   So   I   think   that   this   is   gonna   be   the   best   chance   of   us   both   getting   people   into   the   office   with   a   doctor   they   feel   con-   confident   and   comfortable   about,   and   then   getting   them   to   that   second   appointment   because   they   got   a   r-   recommendation   that   was   really,   um,   a   strong   one   and   resonates   with   them   personally.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.   So   imagine   that   you're...   You   know,   you   put   yourself   in   the   shoes   of   a,   uh,   queer   person   of   color.   You   find   this   community   that   is   also   around,   like,   uh,   other   people   who   are   of   the   same,   um,   ident-   id-   identity   as   you,   and   they're   also   looking   for   a   doctor.   What   are   some   risks   that   you   might   see   if   you're   using   this   product   and   putting   yourself   in   the   shoes   of   that   person?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   So   I   think   one   risk   is   that...   So   we're   trying   to   make   it   feel   relevant   and   c-   ma-   makes   people   feel   connected.   Um,   but   we're   also   gonna   have   to   walk   the   line   of   confidentiality   and   some   amount   of   anonymity   to   go   back   to   the,   like,   awkwardness   that   we   were   trying   to   avoid   from   that   pain   point   earlier   on.   So   I   think   there's   a   risk   that   we   anonymize   the   personalness   out   of   this   and   this   just   feels   like   any   other   kind   of   message   board   on   the   internet   where   a-   like,   anonymous   people   are   commenting   and,   uh,   sharing   a   lot   of   opinions,   and   you   don't   know   who   you   can   trust.   So   I   think   there's   a   risk   there.   Um,   I   think   we   can   get   around   that   risk   in   a   couple   of   ways.   I   think   it   could   be   interesting   to   have   people   build,   uh,   put   some   investment   into   their   profile.   It   just   would   be   an   anonymized   profile.   So   you   could   build,   for   example,   a   personalized   avatar   and   pick   a   name   and,   and   maybe   pick   a   city   and   provide   some   information   about   yourself   that,   um,   wouldn't...   That,   that   would   weed   out   some   of   the   people   who   might   just   be   there   to   troll,   just   by   having   people   take   some   time,   and   also   adds   a   little   bit   of   identifying   information   to,   um,   decrease   the   feeling   that   this   is   just   like   a   void   of,   of   people   shouting,   which   is   sometimes   how   the   internet   overall   feels.   So   that's,   that's   one,   you   know,   way   we   might   mitigate   that.   Um,   other,   other   questions   or   concerns,   you   know,   any   feature   in   this   space,   I   think   privacy   and   security   are   a   big   concern.   Anything   to   do   with   health   data,   scheduling   doctors   is   just   really   sensitive   information.   And   so,   you   know,   mitigation   there   I   think   would   be   just   investing   and   understanding,   um,   the   sort   of   rules   and   regulations   around   this,   and   investing   in   being   in   very   transparent   with   the   users   throughout   the   process,   especially   when   they're   signing   up.   But   what   happens   to   your   data?   What   can   other   users   see   and   not   see?   What   can   your   doctor   see   and   not   see?   We   really   wanna   maintain   trust   to   the   point   of   like   retaining   the   connection   between   our   tool   and   these   users.   Um,   there's   a   second   one   in   my   mind.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.  
**Candidate:** Um,   oh,   just   one,   one   last   one   is   about,   um,   integrations.I   think   I   mentioned   insurance   providers.   I   would   wanna   know   more   about   both   the   willingness   and   the   ability   of   doctor's   offices   and   insurance   providers   to   share   data   with   a   tool   like   this,   so   it   would   be   far   more   useful   if   that   data   were   integrated   and   would   wanna   dig   into   that.   Um,   there   may   be   some   barriers   there,   and   the   tool   could   be   simplified   such   that   it   didn't   include   that   data,   but   it   would   be   a   big   opportunity   if   it   could.  
**Interviewer:** Cool.   All   right.   Awesome.   Well,   thanks   for   sharing   your   interview,   um,   solution.   And   before   we   get   into   feedback,   I'm   curious   if   you   have   any   self-feedback   you   wanna   share?  
**Candidate:** Definitely.   I   mean,   I   think,   uh,   I,   I   always   need   to   tighten   up   my   description   of   solutions.   I   never   have   quite   the   clarity   there   that   I   would   like.   I   think   it's   potentially   a   case   where   I   might   wanna   try   and   bring   in   some   visuals   or   something   else   just   to   keep   it   really   easy   to   understand.   So,   I   think   that's   one.   In   general,   I   also   feel   like   I   could   be   briefer   and   clearer,   um,   so   trying   to   kind   of   increase   the,   the   snappiness.   Um,   and   I   think   the   last   thing   would   be   really   keeping   it   connected   to   the   success   metrics   and   the   vision.   Um,   I   sort   of   picked   a   hybrid   of   two   pain   points,   and   then   that   might   have   kinda...   That,   that   could   have   felt   a   little   clearer,   the   through   line   between   success   metrics,   vision,   and   pain   points.   So,   I   think   if   I   were   to   do   it   again,   I   would   try   and   tighten   up   that   sort   of   three-point   connection.  
**Interviewer:** Absolutely.   And   I   think   one   thing   that   I   would   also   do   is,   is   proactively   call   out   risks   as   you're   going   through   the   solution.   So,   you'll   talk   about   the,   uh,   community's   idea,   and   then   you   can   call   out   the   risks   around   security   and   privacy   and   the   need   for   maybe   some   sort   of   anonymity   or   semi-anonymity,   and,   uh,   I   think   that'll   be   very   powerful   if   you   can   do   that.   So,   a   feedback   from   my   end   is   that   you   can   call   out   risks   for   your   solution   as   you're   going   through.   So,   for   example,   when   you're   talking   about   the   communities,   you   can   call   out   risks,   uh,   proactively   about   anonymity   or   semi-anonymity   and   the   needs   for   security.   That's   it   for   today's   mock   PM   interview.   For   the   audience,   good   luck   with   your   upcoming   PM   interview.
