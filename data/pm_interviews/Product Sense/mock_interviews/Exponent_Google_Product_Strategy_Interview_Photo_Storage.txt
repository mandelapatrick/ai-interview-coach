**Interviewer:** Amazon   announced   it's   launching   free   storage   for   unlimited   photos,   and   let's   say   you're   the   PM   for   Google   Photos,   what   would   you   do?   (instrumental music)   Hey,   everyone.   Welcome   back   to   another   Exponent   Product   Management   Mock   Interview.   My   name   is   Kevin   Wei,   and   on   today's   show   we   have   Halim.   Um,   before   we   get   started,   Halim,   can   you   just   tell   the   audience   who   you   are?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   sure.   Hi,   Kevin.   Um,   I'm   a,   I'm   currently   a   product   manager   at   Facebook.   Uh,   I've   been   at   Facebook   for   four   years.   I   worked   on   Facebook   Profiles,   I   launched,   uh,   and   kickstarted   Facebook   Avatars,   uh,   internally.   Uh,   worked   on   virtual   reality   for   two   years.   And   currently   I'm   working   on,   uh,   on   Marketplace.   Um,   it's   a   product   that   helps,   uh,   workers   find   work   in,   in   the   middle   of   the   pandemic.   Previous   to   Facebook,   I   was   a   founder.   Um,   launched   a   couple   of   companies,   one   of   which   got   acquired   by   a   coupon   website   in   London.  
**Interviewer:** Very   exciting.   And,   I   mean,   Halim's   being   humble.   He   also   has,   uh,   many   great   offers.   He's   coming   from   the   course,   he,   um,   studied   the   Exponent   course,   and   currently   has   offers   at,   um,   Google   and   Stripe.   So   congratulations,   I'm   really   happy   to   hear   that,   Halim.  
**Candidate:** Thanks.  
**Interviewer:** Um,   today   let's   do   a   strategy   question   for   this   mock   interview.   So   here's   the   question.   Amazon   announced   it's   launching   free   storage   for   unlimited   photos,   and   let's   say   you're   the   PM   for   Google   Photos,   what   would   you   do?  
**Candidate:** Great.   Thanks   for   the   question.   Uh,   I'll   take   a   minute...   Uh,   I'll   take   a   few   moments   to   gather   my   thoughts,   if   that's   okay.  
**Interviewer:** Great.  
**Candidate:** Great,   awesome.   Um,   before   I   jump   in,   I   do   have   a   few   clarifying   questions,   if   that's   okay.   Um,   so,   uh,   the,   the   first   one   is,   uh,   about   the,   "What   would   you   do?"   Uh,   are   we   focusing   here   on   a   holistic   strategy,   um,   effectively,   you   know,   we're   not   talking   about,   uh,   many   product   improvements   like   A/B   tests,   but   rather,   you   know,   large,   uh,   large   projects   we   would   take   on   to   basically   counter   that   risk?   Correct?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   So   you're   the   PM,   I'm   just   really   curious   about   what   you   would   do   when   you   hear   this   announcement   from   Amazon.   And   if   you   have   any   big   ideas,   I'd   love   to   hear   what   they   are.  
**Candidate:** Awesome.   That   sounds   great.   And   constraint-wise,   uh,   I   am   going   to   assume   that,   uh,   yeah,   we,   we,   we're   operating   within   the   realm   of   the   possible,   but,   um-  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.  
**Candidate:** ...   that's,   uh,   we,   we   have   a,   a   large   team   and   we   can,   uh,   we   can   create,   um,   uh,   we   can   create   things,   uh,   at   scale.   So   I   shouldn't,   um,   I'm   not   going   to   limit   myself   with,   uh,   when   it   comes   to   ideas.   Does   that   sound   good?  
**Interviewer:** Uh,   yeah,   you   don't,   don't   limit   yourself   to   any   resource   constraints.  
**Candidate:** Perfect.   Sounds   good.   All   right.   Um,   so   here's...   I'm   going   to   share   my   screen   just   to,   uh,   use   this   as   a   whiteboard.   Um,   so   here's   how   I   would   like   to   go   through   this.   Um,   I'm   gonna   start   by,   uh,   just,   you   know,   grounding   us   in,   uh,   in   the   mission   of   the   product   itself.   So   Google   Photos,   but   also   talking   about   Google   itself.   Um,   what   is,   what   is   it   that   the   product   is,   what   is   it   that   Google   is   trying   to   accomplish?   What   its,   what   is   its   mission,   and   what   are   Google   Photos   trying   to   accomplish?   Um,   I'll   then   go   t-   through   just,   you   know,   really,   you   know,   Porter's   Five,   uh,   Forces.   And   the,   the   reason   why   I   want   to   go   through   this   is   almost,   um,   just   like   a   checklist   of   all   the   things   I   need   to   keep   in   mind,   uh,   before   I   move   into   the   next   steps,   which   is,   uh,   use   cases.   Uh,   what,   what   are   customers   after?   What,   what   do   they   want   from   prod-   from   photo   storage   products,   like   Google   Photos,   and   what,   what   it   seems   Amazon   wants   to   offer   now,   free   storage.   Um,   and   then   I'll   do,   um,   I   guess,   uh,   y-   uh,   c-   a   competition,   a   competitive,   uh,   analysis,   uh,   you   know,   kind   of   Go-   Goo-   Google   Photos   versus   Amazon,   Amazon   Photos,   and   see,   um,   and,   and   line   up   strengths   and   weaknesses.   So   what   I   would   like   us   to   get   to,   uh,   is   something   along   these   lines.   So   Google's   Photos,   let's   just   call   the   new   product   Amazon   Photos,   maybe   supposing   it's   part   of   Prime,   and   then   kind   of   strengths   and   weaknesses.   Uh,   and   from   there,   I'd   like...   Once,   once   I've   lined   that   up,   I   think   I   can   come   up   with   a   plan,   um,   some   suggestions,   kind   of   a   recommendation   at   that   stage.   And   then   think   through   some   risks   and,   you   know,   what   would   success   look   like   in   the   end.   Cool.   Um,   as   our   structure,   how,   how   does   that   sound,   before   I,   before   I   kick   things   off?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   this   sounds   good.   Um,   let's   get   started.  
**Candidate:** Cool.   Sounds   good.   Um,   so,   uh,   Goo-   Google   and   Google   Photos.   Uh,   Google's   mission,   uh,   at   a   high   level   is   to   organize   the   world's   information   in   a,   um,   in   a   way   that   is   accessible   and   useful   to   everyone.   Um,   and   Google   Photos   fits,   uh,   very   neatly   into   that   larger   mission.   It   is,   uh,   a   way   to   organize,   uh,   everyone's,   uh,   everyone's   photos.   But   specifically,   you   know,   what   photos   are   to   people   are   their   memories,   their   past.   And   so   from   an   emotional   point   of   view,   it's   definitely   one   of   Google's,   um,   most,   um,   uh,   m-   most   valuable   assets,   because   it   is   helping,   uh,   c-   create   an   emotional   link   for   people.   It   is   getting,   uh,   a   job   to   be   done,   uh,   an   essential   job   to   be   done,   um,   uh,   y-   uh,   f-   fulfilled   for   people.   Um,   and   so   from,   uh,   fr-   from   a   mission   point   of   view,   Google   Photos   wants   to   become   the,   almost   like   the   library   of   people's   pasts   and   memories,   um,   and   make   that   very   accessible,   right?   So   make   one's   past   very   accessible,   and   easily,   uh,   and   easily   organize   it.   Uh,   there   are   a   bunch   of   amazing   features   in   there.   I   can   think   of   assistants,   uh,   that   creates,   you   know,   photo   albums,   all   the   way   to,   you   know,   an   am-   some   amazing   search   features   that   can   search   for,   um,   you   know,   people's   faces   and,   uh,   animals   or   scenes   in   a   nightclub,   stuff   like   that.   So   it's   a   very   advanced   product.   And,   um,   uh,   if   I   were   to   think...   If,   if   I   am,   if   I   jump   ahead   for,   uh,   uh,   for   a   second   here   and   think   about,   a   bit   about   the   landscape,   the   competitive   landscape,   um......   I,   it   almost   seems   like   at   one   point   there   was   a   lot   of   competition   around   pho-   photos   storage.   So   there   was,   there   were   Moments   by   Facebook,   and   Carousel   by   Dropbox.   But   then   just,   you   know,   uh,   in   the   last   couple   of   years,   I   think   Google   pho-   it   became   very   clear   that   Google   Photos   is   the   winner   in   that   market.   They   simply   took   over.   And   I   think   it's   really   due   to   that   unlimited   storage   they've   created,   uh,   they,   they've   proposed   to   everyone,   uh,   for   free.   It   became,   uh,   almost   impossible   to   compete   with   Google   Photos.   And,   uh,   yeah,   I'm   sure   Google's   operating   at   a,   uh,   at   a   loss   here.   Uh,   that's   probably   why   in   June   2021,   a,   a   payment   plan   is   going   to   kick   in.   And   maybe   that's   why,   you   know,   in   this   hypothetical   world   we're   wo-   we're   working   in,   Amazon   Photos   actually   wants   to,   um,   introduce   free   storage   as   a,   as   a   way   for   people   to,   to   opt   for   it,   because   they're,   they   might   start   paying   for,   for   Google   photos.   So   yeah,   that,   that's   from   a   landscape   point   of   view,   Google   Photos   seems   like   now   the,   the,   the   clear   winner.   I   think   they   have,   uh,   1.2   billion   people   using   the   product   or   something   like   that.   Um,   if   I   have   to   think   about,   you   know,   uh,   Porter's   five   here   doesn't   really   apply.   Like,   alternatives   and   substitutes,   uh,   you   know,   the   best   thing   to   do   th-   there   aren't   really   much,   because   people   can   either   keep,   uh,   photos   on   their   phones   or   need   to   upload   them   into   Google   Photos,   which,   you   know,   that's   how,   uh,   uh,   a   lot   of   people   do.   They   have   this,   this   photo   upload,   uh,   going   on.   Um,   yeah,   and   so   that's   one   of   the   advantages   of   Google   Photos,   just   does   things   in   the,   in   the   background.   Um,   and   if   I   were   to,   uh,   if   I   were   to   stop   here   and   think   a   bit   about   the   customers   that   use   this,   I   think   Android   users   have   a   definite   advantage.   I   think   Pix-   people   who   own   a   Pixel,   um,   definitely,   uh,   you   know,   get   it,   get   special   pricing   or   three   months,   three   months   for   free,   or   I   think   also   unlimited   storage   for   the   high-quality   images.   So   they're,   they're   privileged   in,   in   a   way.   Um,   and   then   all   other   users   also   are   getting   unlimited   storage   right   now,   but   maybe   not   for   the   high-quality   images,   is,   as   far   as   I,   as   I   remember.   Um,   and   moving   on   to   the   use   cases.   So   g-   keeping   these   customers   in   mind,   uh,   if   I   think   about   the   use   cases,   what   customers   are   looking   for   are   a   few   things.   Like,   they   want,   you   know,   free   storage,   right?   So   basically,   the   job   to   be   done   here,   uh,   or   the   use   case   is   store.   The   next   one   is   search.   Uh,   they,   they   simply   want   to   search   for   their   old   pictures,   like   find   them   and   be,   be   able   to   find   the   specific   pictures,   a   spec-   spec-   specific   picture   or   specific   moment.   And   I   think   Google   is   really,   like,   is   getting   really,   really   good   at   that.   And   then   they   want   to   almost,   like,   organize   and   curate,   just   like   they   would   in   the,   um,   analog   world,   just   create   albums   and   things   like   that.   Uh,   so   keeping   thing,   th-   these   things   in   mind,   um,   and   knowing   that   Google   Photos   is   delivering   on   all   of   these,   um,   I   want   to   jump   into   what   is   it   that   differentiates   Google   Photos   and   Amazon   Photos.   And   really,   it's   not,   you   know,   Amazon   Photos   yet,   it's   really   Amazon   at   large.   Um,   if   I   were   to   think   about   Amazon,   yeah,   one   of   the   things   that   come   to   mind,   um,   is,   uh,   is,   is   the   genero-   uh,   I'm   gonna   call   it   generosity   or,   you   know,   uh,   I   don't   wanna   call   it   cheap.   Uh,   but,   but   it's,   Amazon   is   very   competitive   when   it   comes   to   pricing.   So   it's   a,   it's   a   very   generous   company.   Uh,   Prime   almost   feels   like   a   steal,   right?   It's   almost   like,   uh,   uh,   irrational   to   not,   to   not   pay   for   Amazon   Prime   at   this   stage.   And   so   it   has   this   generosity.   It   also   has   a,   a   great   bundle   of,   of   products   with   Prime.   So   Prime,   you   know,   Prime   is   very,   uh,   is   a   great,   um,   is   a   great   pro-   proposition   in   that,   in   that   sense   Uh,   if   I   were   to   think   about   Amazon's   weaknesses,   however,   I   think   from   a   UX   and   UI   perspective,   just   as   a   product,   it's   a   bit   confusing.   Um,   the   social   aspect   is   definitely   not   one   of   Amazon's   forts-   forte.   Like,   they   don't   have   a   social   graph,   whereas,   like,   photos   are   very   much,   um,   you   know,   are,   are   a   very   social   product.   Um,   if   I   were   to   think   about   Google   Photos'   weaknesses,   I   do   think   actually   also   Google   doesn't   have   a   strong   social   graph,   hasn't   captured   that,   unfortunately.   Um,   another   thing   I   can   think   of   is,   um,   people...   Just,   like,   almost   like   a   c-   cos-   consumer   apathy,   uh,   as   in   people   don't   always...   Like,   they   rely   more   on   their   phones   to   store   all   of   these   photos,   or   maybe   on   some,   uh,   arcane   ways   like   a   USB,   et   cetera.   So   either   apathy   or   ignorance,   and   that's   what   keeping   people   from   using   Google   Photos.   And   so   integrating   into   phones   like   Pixel   is   very   powerful.   Um,   makes   me   almost   think,   like,   you   know,   is   there   a   potential   with   Drive,   for   instance?   Jumping   to   ideas   for-   for   a   bit   here,   but   just...   Yeah.   So   like   can   we   leverage   Drive   basically   to   really   capture   everyone,   automatically   capture   everyone's   pictures   and   get   them   into   the   product,   like   an   acquisition   mechanism?   And   then   from   strength,   I   think   this   is,   th-   that's   the   juicy   part,   as   in   Google   from   a   machine   learning,   you   know,   j-   Google's   technology,   uh,   assistant   technology,   uh,   intelligence   around   context   is,   um,   is   second   to   none.   And   it's   definitely   something   that   can   be   leveraged   here.   There's   also   a   very   strong   ecosystem.   Like,   there's   Gmail   and   Maps   and,   um,   um,   so   many...   Um,   what   else?   (laughs)   Uh,   they...   We   have   Chrome,   um,   other   products   that,   uh,   people   use   on   a   daily   basis.   Everything   from   Trips   to   Notes   to   et   cetera.   Uh,   so   a   lot   of   products,   you   know,   that,   that   are,   that,   that   can   be   leveraged   here   to   basically   enforce,   uh,   Google   Photos.   And   looking   at   this   and   everything   we've   already   talked   about,   what   I   would   like   to   do   is,   you   know,   to,   to   start,   uh,   penning   down   a   strategy   here,   to   answer   your   question.   So   as   a   PM   for   Google   Photos,   knowing   that   Amazon   is   about   to   launch   free   storage,   what   would   I   do   Um,   I   would   want   to...   So   for   Amazon's   weaknesses,   I   want   to,   you   know,   ha-   hammer   their   weaknesses,   or   like,   uh,   attack,   counter,   um,   press,   press   against   their   weaknesses,   if   that   makes   sense.   I   would   want   to,   uh,   minimize   my   own   weaknesses   as,   as   a   Google   Photos   product.   Um,   I   want   to.....   co-opt,   not   copy.   Co-opt   or   like   get-   get   inspiration   from   Amazon's   generosity   and   bundle   and   Prime.   And   then   when   it   comes   to   my   strengths,   I   want   to   leverage   my   strengths,   right?   I   want   to   lean   into   these   strengths.   And   so   that's   the,   uh-  
**Interviewer:** Do   you   think   the   weakness,   uh,   do   you   think   the   weakness   of   social   graph   or   the   lack   of   social   graph   is   something   that's   really   important?   If,   if   you   were   to   sort   of   rank   the   weaknesses,   where,   where   might   you   put   these   different   weaknesses?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   excellent   question.   That's,   that's   exactly   what   I,   what   I   had   in   mind   to   do   'cause   there   are-   there   is   a   lot   here.   So   of   all   of   these   things,   what   should   I,   uh,   leverage,   what   should   I   minimize,   et   cetera.   Um,   so...   Oh,   sorry.   Oh.   Uh,   so   let's   start   with   minimize   actually,   to   your   question,   between   consumer   apathy   and   ignorance   and   social   graph.   Uh,   that's   a   great   question   because   I,   it   forces   me   to   take   a   step   back   here   and   think   about   Google,   Google   Photo's   goals,   right?   Um,   if   we   are   in   a   competitive   landscape   like   this,   like   this   hypothetical   scenario,   then   immediately   the   goal   becomes,   uh,   both   acquisition...   Uh,   really,   actually   revisiting   this,   not,   not   acquisition   as   much   as   engagement.   As   in   we   want   to   create...   The,   the   goal   then   becomes,   uh,   to   create   a   strategic   moat   as   fast   as   possible.   And   by   a   moat,   I   mean   something   that's   very   defensible   so   that   Amazon   Photos   cannot,   you   know,   just   come,   create   another   commodity   product   for   free   storage   and   take   over   our   market.   Um,   and   so   of   these   two,   between   consumer   apathy   and   social   graph,   I   think,   you   know,   like   we,   we   will   always,   uh,   compete   on,   we   will   always,   uh,   build   the   same   tools   as   Amazon.   Everyone   will   build   the   same   tools   to   get   people   to   get,   to   upload   their   photos   to   their   system.   But   a   social   graph   is   not   something   that's   easily   replicable.   So   I   would   want   to   focus   on   that,   uh,   primarily.   Yeah,   that's   how   I   would,   um,   uh,   prioritize   these   two.  
**Interviewer:** So   what   do   you   think   is   the   moat   for,   for   Google   Photos   today?   And   what   do   you   think   is   the   moat   for   Amazon?  
**Candidate:** Hmm.   Good   question.   Um,   I   think   the   mo-   so   the   moat   for   Google   Photos   today   has   been   for   the   longest   time   that   it   has   captured   a   lot   of,   uh,   people's   existing   photos   so   that   the   cost   of   moving   one's   photos   is   high.   Um,   but,   and,   and   so   the...   Uh,   it's   almost   like   this...   It   almost   feels   like   this   is   the   only   moat.   Like,   the   moat   right   now   is   just   convenience   or   the   pain   of   moving   my   photos   to   somewhere   else.   Uh,   and   that's...   My,   my,   my   opinion   is   that   it   is   not   enough   of   a   moat.   We   need   to,   to   create   another,   another   moat   layer   or   what-   whatever   we   wanna   call   it.   And   that's,   that's   where   the   strategy   comes   in.   Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** And   then   go-  
**Candidate:** For   Amazon...  
**Interviewer:** Right,   right.   So,   so   I   was   gonna   ask   as   you   were   just   gonna   go   in   the   direction   of,   uh,   you're   not   the   PM   for   Amazon,   and   we   don't   really   know   what   Amazon   Photos   looks   like,   but   if   you   were   to   guess   what   might   Amazon's   moat...   Like,   if   you   were   a   PM,   what   do   you   think   they   would   try   to,   uh,   make   the   moat?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   Yeah.   Um,   I   would   th-   I,   I   do   think   they   would   double   down   on   this   generosity/bundle,   uh,   you   know,   um,   advantage   they   have.   So,   um,   things   that   could   come   to   mind   is,   if   you   start   storing   your   pictures   for   free   with   us,   uh,   you   might   have   a   discount   on   y-   your   Prime   membership.   Your   Prime   membership   costs   you   less.   That's   pretty   extreme   to   be   honest.   Um,   rather   we   could   print   a   photo   book   for   free   for   you.   Uh,   Amazon   probably   ha-   you   know,   already   has   KDP,   Kindle   Direct   Publishing,   so   they   could   do   that.   Whereas   Google   Photos   charges   to   print   all   of   these   pictures   today,   right?   Uh,   so   that,   that   is   the   kind   of,   um,   edge   that   Amazon   would   have.   Uh,   really,   you   know,   offering   things   for   free   or   for   a   very   competitive   price.  
**Interviewer:** Great.   So   thanks   for   breaking   that   down.   So   now   it   looks   like...   So   you've   underlined   social   graph.   Is   that   the   weakness   you   sort   of   wanna   focus   on?  
**Candidate:** I   do...   I...   This...   Uh,   I   do   think   it's...   Uh,   it's   one   of   them,   but   it's...   I   do   think   it's   a   multiprone   approach.   So   the   way   I   would   line,   um,   um,   uh,   line   this   up   is,   is   the   following.   Something   like   this.   So,   uh,   where   we   could   even   add   actually   an   extra   column   here.   So   call   this   pros   and   cons.   Maybe   we   won't   go   too   much   into   details,   but   basically   what   I   keep   in   mind   as   I   go   through   this   is,   one,   I   wanna   make   sure   that   we're   building   a   strategic   moat,   right?   So   that's   what   I'm   going   to   evaluate   each   of   these   ideas   based   on.   And   number   two,   I   wanna   lean   into   my   strengths,   le-   lean   into   Google's   strengths,   right?   And   make   sure   we   are,   you   know,   we're   playing   to   these.   And   so   ideas   that   come   to   mind   are   inspired   by   this.   One,   when   it   comes   to   the   social   graph,   for   instance,   uh,   one   thing   that   I   find   strange   is   that   I   can   identify   people   in,   in   Google,   but   I   don't   have   their   Gmail,   right?   So   like   can...   So   I   don't   have   their   Gmail   and   Google   doesn't   know   who   they   are.   So   they   don't...   Uh,   so   almost   like   asking   people...   Yeah,   I   feel   I'm,   I'm   rushing   into   this   one.   Um,   I'll   take   a   m-   if   that's   okay,   uh,   Steven,   I'll   take   a   minute   just   to   gather   my   ideas   here.   How   does   that   sound?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   I'm   Kevin.  
**Candidate:** Kevin,   sorry.   (laughs)  
**Interviewer:** (laughs)   No   worries.  
**Candidate:** I'll,   I'll  
**Interviewer:** Go   ahead.   No   worries.   Take   your   time.  
**Candidate:** Kevin,   I'll   take   a   minute   to   think   through   this.   Thanks.   Awesome.   Okay,   great.   Um,   so   here   are   the   three   things.   Apologies   for,   for   the   name   thing   here.   Um,   so   here   are   the   things   that   come   to   mind.   The   first   one   is,   um,   I'm   just   gonna   thematize   them.   So   the   first   one   call,   uh,   I   call   social   intelligence   as   in,   uh,   understanding,   um,   relationships   between   people   present   in   pictures.   The   reason   why   this   is   important   is   because,   um,   you   know,   we   could   build   almost   like   social   streak   systems.   If   I'm   in   a   picture   very   often   with   someone,   um,   Google   could   deduce   that   this   person   is   important   to   me.   And   so   create   an   album   or   suggest   things   that   are,   you   know,   truly,   uh,   that   just   highlight   my   relationship   with   this   person   versus   just   tell   me   what   happened   a   year   ago,   right?   And   so,   uh,   almost   like   double,   double   down   or   highlight   important   relationships.   I'll   keep   it   broad   for   a   second   here.And   we   can   double-click   into   it   if   you'd   like.   The   second   one   would   be   something   around   contextual   intelligence.   And   this   leverages   the   spark   that   I   spoke   about   earlier,   which   is   the   ecosystem.   Um,   for   instance,   if   I'm   in,   you   know,   if   I'm   in   maps,   right,   and   I'm   in,   I'm   visiting,   um,   let's   say   L-   Las   Vegas   again.   Terrible   example.   Uh,   uh,   Google,   G-   Google   photos   should,   could   show   me   basically   the   last   time   I   was   in   Vegas.   Uh,   rather,   Maps   could   show   me,   like,   the   photos   of   the   last   time   I   was   in   Vegas.   I'm   sure,   you   know,   there   are   some   cons   here   regarding,   like,   privacy.   And   I   know   that   there's   almost   like   a   Chi-   a   China   wall   between   the   different,   um,   uh,   uh,   between   the   different,   uh,   products   at,   at   Google.   So   I   would   keep   that   in   mind.   But,   you   know,   the   last   time   you   were   in   Vegas   would   be,   uh,   a   kind,   you   know,   something   to   increase   that   contextual   intelligence,   because   that's   something   Amazon   will   never   offer   me.   Amazon   doesn't   have   access   to,   to   Maps.   Uh,   same   for,   um,   I'd   say,   you   know,   o-   other   things   is   like   time.   So   Google   has   Notes,   for   instance.   Um,   maybe   it   could,   you   know,   remind   me   of,   um,   a   picture,   a   picture   I   took,   maybe   as   a,   as   a   reminder,   if   I   can   tag   a   picture.   It's   a   loose   idea,   but,   you   know,   effectively   relating   maybe   notes   in   s-   in   some   way,   um,   connecting   notes   to   photos.   Um,   it's   a,   it's   a   blurry   idea.   I'll,   I'll   pass   on   this   one   and,   and   scratch   it   for   now.   But   basically   an   idea   to   connect,   you   know,   more   of,   of   Google   photos.   And   the   last   one   is,   um,   this   one,   inspire,   you   know,   inspiration,   and   specifically   the,   the   bundle,   the   Prime   bundle   thing,   uh,   idea.   Uh,   Google   has   Google   One   today.   And   so,   uh,   bundling   photos   into   Google   One   in   a   very   advantages   way,   advantageous   way,   though   people   have   to   pay   for   it,   would   be,   like,   o-   would   be   an   essential   move   in,   in   my   opinion   here.   Um,   and   I   think   the   three,   the   three   of   these   would   be   like   the   basis,   the,   the   starting   strategy,   uh,   to,   to,   to,   to   get   at   this,   and   to,   uh,   create,   create   the   defenses   against,   uh,   against   the   risk   of   free   storage   proposed   by   Amazon.  
**Interviewer:** Let's   double-click   into   the   highlight   important   relationships.   Um,   I'm   not   really   clear   what   that   means.  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   that   sounds   good.   So,   um,   what   I   meant   by   that   is,   uh,   if   you   click   on   Search   in   Google   Photos,   uh,   you'll   see   people's   faces   right   on   top   as   circles.   Um,   and   Google   Photos   will   even   ask   you   to,   you   know,   whether,   whether   this   is   the   right   person   in   that   photo,   et   cetera.   But   effectively,   you   know,   Google   Photos   recognizes   peoples   in,   in   photos.   Um,   and   you   can   even   name   them.   So   I've   called   my   fr-   you   know,   my   friend   David,   et   cetera.   Uh,   what,   what   is   interesting   in,   in   this   case   is   to,   um,   go,   go   a   level   deeper   into   that.   And   so,   so   either,   either   one,   uh,   one   of   two   things.   One,   um,   on   the   main   page   of   photos,   right   now,   there   are   stories.   So   what   happened   a   year   ago,   what   happened   two   years   ago   on   this   day.   Instead,   highlighting,   uh,   what   I've   done   with   friends   at   this   time,   uh,   what   I've   done   in   friends   at   a   specific   place,   or,   um,   you   know,   how   long   it's   been   s-   or   even   statistics   about,   uh,   you   know,   you've   taken   that   many   pictures   with   this   person   versus   that   many   pictures   with   this   other   person.   And   almost   like,   um,   um,   Snapchat's   streak   system   showing   me   effectively   how   my   friendships   stack   up   against   each   other,   how   much   time   I'm   spending   with,   with   people.   The   second   one,   um,   Google   Photos   has   a   messaging   option   now   where   you   can   message   other   people.   It   would   be   interesting   to   just,   you   know,   in   these   messages,   um,   p-   pre-populate   some   messages   for   the   people   who   matter   most   to   me.   So   if   it's   David,   and   if   I   identify   them   as   David,   maybe   link   it   to   their   Gmail,   and   then   be   able   to   send   an   album   on   a   specific   day   to   Gmail   and   send   me   a   notification,   uh,   to   David,   my   friend,   telling   him,   "On   this   day,   we   spent,   you   know,   this   time   together   in   Columbia,   and   we   did   X   and   Y   and   Z."   And   so   cr-   auto-creating   memories   not   only   for   my,   uh,   viewing,   but   to   connect   with   people.   And   so   going   a   step   further   than   just   creating   memories   and   curating   these   to   help   you   connect   with   people   around   memories.   I   think   that   is   the,   the   shift   there.   Um,   yeah,   that's   what   I   had   in   mind   for   this   one.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.   Um,   that's   really   interesting.   I'm   kind   of   curious   which   one   you   might   pick.  
**Candidate:** Of   all   of   these?   That's   a   great   question.   So   that's   where   the   pros   and   cons   comes   in.   Uh,   I   do   think   there's   a,   uh,   the,   the,   the   one   that   jumps   at   me   from   a   cons   perspective   is   this   whole   privacy   around   contextual   intelligence.   Um,   I'm   not   sure   how   much,   uh,   I-   I'm   not   knowledgeable   enough   about   how   much   different   Google   products   can   talk   to   each   other.   So   I'd,   I'd   be   a   bit   wary   about   this   one.   Um,   the   pros,   however,   is   that,   you   know,   from   a   strategic   mode   perspective,   it's   truly,   you   know,   very   defensible,   uh,   very   hard   to   replicate,   right?   (keyboard clacking)   So   that's   one.   Uh,   Google   One,   I   think   it's   a,   you   know,   it's   almost   an   easy   one.   Now   I'm   questioning   whether   these   other   right   columns,   it's   almost   like,   you   know,   effort,   we   could   rename   them   to   effort,   risk,   um,   and   then   impact,   something   like   that.   That'll   make   things   easier.   Uh,   and   so   very   hard   to   replicate,   this   is,   uh,   hmm,   what   is   that?   That's   I   guess,   impact/strategic   importance.   (keyboard clacking)   Um,   so   from   an   effort   perspective,   I   do   think   this   one   is,   uh,   kind   of   medium.   I   don't   think   it's   too   hard   to   implement.   Contextual  
**Candidate:** (instrumental music)  
**Candidate:** ...   is   v-   this   is   a   high   one.   Google   One   photos,   this   is   a   easy   one,   so   low.   Um,   risk   is,   um,   medium   in   this   case,   because   we   would   be   asking   users'   approval   at   each   stage.   (keyboard clacking)   I   do   think   the   importance   is   high.   In   this   case,   the   impact   is   high.   Uh,   very   hard   to   replicate,   this   would   be   high.   Uh,   but   the   risk   is   high   as   well.   Um,   and   then   Google   One   photos,   the   risk   is   low,   and   the   impact   would   be   medium   rather   than   low.   So   th-   this   just   gives   me,   you   know,   uh,   an,   a   high-level   idea   about   social   intelligence   being   the   ide-   the,   the   thing   f-   to   go   for.   Um-But   I,   I   would   still,   in-   in-   in   a   given   strategy,   I   would   want   to,   uh...   So   I   would   suggest   social   intelligence   as   a   thing   we   would   start   with,   but   I   would   want   contextual   intelligence   as   something   we   look   into   as   well,   um,   because   it   is,   it   is   kind   of   longer   term   investment   that   can   truly   differentiate   our   product   in   the   future.   Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** So   social   intelligence,   sort   of   like,   um,   nostalgia   kind   of   feature   where   you're   using   machine   learning   also?   Okay,   interesting.   Yeah.   You-   you-   you   did   point   out   that   that   was   one   of   Google's   strengths   on   the   photos   team.   Um,   great.   Yeah.   Um,   h-   so   in   the   past,   Google   has   definitely   tried   to   add   social   aspects   to   its-   its   products,   like   Google   Circles   and   Google+,   right?   Um,   what   sort   of   learning   lessons   might   you   think   we   can   take   from   that   and   make   sure   we   don't   fail   in   the   same,   uh,   realm   when   we're   trying   to   build   these   sort   of   social   features   here?  
**Candidate:** Y-   yeah.   That's   a   great   question.   I'm   sure   there's   a   post-mortem   somewhere   internally,   uh,   about   this.   Um,   let   me...   I-   I'll   take   a-   a   few   seconds   to   think   through   this   one.   So   a-   a   few   things   actually   that   come   to   mind,   uh,   having   worked   at   Facebook   for-   for   a   while.   When   it   comes   to   sharing   and   to   social   dynamics,   there   are   actually   some   key   principles   that,   um,   that-   that   social   products   use   and-   and   leverage.   Um,   I'll-   I'll   start   with   a   couple   of   lessons   that   Google   needs   to   keep   in,   would   need   to   keep   in   mind   in   this   case.   One,   the   importance   of   building   on   an   existing   use   case   rather   than   building   a   completely   new,   uh,   new   product   that   almost   is,   you   know,   parachuted   onto   people.   And   so   in   this   case,   it   would   be,   you   know,   instead   of   building   a   Google+,   rather,   uh,   building   on   top   of   something   that   already   has   a   lot   of   value   and   that   people   are   using.   So   Google   Photos,   for   instance,   right?   Uh,   number   two   is   keeping   it   simple.   Uh,   Circles   did   introduce   this   idea   of,   you   know,   being   able   to   create   circles,   uh,   or   Google+   introduced   Circles,   which   was   great   and   made   a   lot   of   sense.   Um,   however,   there   was   an   amount   of   investment,   um,   to-   to   kick   things   off,   right?   And   so   in   this   case,   we   would   need   that   single   core   feature   that   we   built   to   be   as   simple   as   possible.   Uh,   something   that-   that's   very   easy.   And   I   think   our   technology,   our   assistant,   our   social   int-   the   social   intelligence   will   help   us   get   there.   The   third   one   is,   uh,   mimicry.   Um,   you   know,   social   networks   thrive   on   mimicry.   So,   and-   and   I   think   that's-   that's   one   that's   going   to   be   hard   to   solve   in   this   case,   um,   unfortunately,   because   Google   Photos   is   a   very   private   product.   It   isn't   a   social   public   product.   Um,   and   so   we   would-   we   would   need   to   create,   um...   Either   give   people   a   way   to   export   whatever,   you   know,   artifact   they   create   within   Google   Photos,   um,   or   even   create   a   mini   network   of   sorts   within   Google   Photos   around   friends.   So   like,   almost   like   Google   Photos   could   become   this   new,   uh,   this   new,   uh,   smaller   social   network,   a   private   social   network   of   sorts.   Um,   yeah,   but   these-   these...   So   building   on   an   existing   use   case,   keeping   it   simple,   and   mimicry   are   the   three   things   I   would   keep   in   mind.  
**Interviewer:** Great.   And,   uh,   do   you   think   that   your   social   intelligence   feature   here,   uh,   hits   on   these   that   you've   just   mentioned?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   Great,   great   question.   I   do   think   it   builds   on   an   existing   use   case.   I   do   think   it   keeps   it   simple.   Uh,   when   it   comes   to   mimicry,   I   would   need...   I,   like,   we-   we   could   go   into   a   complete   tangent   on   product   design   basically,   but   there-   there-   there's   more   to   bake   into   here   to-   to   make   sure   that   there   is   because   at   this   stage,   I'll-   I'll   just...   So   the   assistant   will   suggest   an   album,   uh,   for   me   to   share   with   my   friend   David   based   on   their   Gmail.   Uh,   but   then   after   that,   what   happens,   right?   Will   David   share   back   with   me?   We'll   have   a   conversation,   but   no   one   outside   of   this   interaction   will   actually,   uh,   will   actually   do   that.   So   there-   there's-   there's   more   to   it   to   dig   into   there.   Maybe   leveraging   photos   where   there   are   multiple   people   and   s-   you   know,   creating   conversation   with   multiple   people.   Uh,   that   would   help   with   the-   the   viral   factor.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.   Great.   Um,   so   I   think   you've   already   mentioned   some   risks   here.   Um,   if   you   want,   um,   feel   free   to   mention   some   more,   but   if-   if-   if   that   was   everything,   why   don't   we   move   on   to   success?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   I   think,   uh,   I   think   I've   covered   enough,   uh,   enough   risks,   especially   around   this,   uh,   you   know,   using   several,   uh,   Google   products   as   part   of   the   strategy.   Uh,   when   it   comes   to   success   and   the   way   I   would   evaluate   whether   this   is,   uh,   the   right,   the   right   next   move,   um,   what   I   would   do   is   go   back   to   where   we   started.   So,   uh,   we   spoke   about   engagement   as   the,   um,   the   goal   that   what-   what-   what   Google   Photos   would,   is,   needs   to   accomplish   now   to   defend   itself   against   any,   any   future   strategic   threats   such   as   Amazon,   et   cetera.   And   so,   uh,   looking   back   with,   um,   how   would   we   measure   success,   right?   If-   if   it's   engagement,   what   is   engagement   in   this   case?   Um,   is   it   simply...   There-   there   are   quite   a   few   things,   you   know,   that   define   engagement   in   Google   Photos,   and   it's   not   just   scrolling   through-   through   the   photos,   uh,   on   the   main   page.   Uh,   it's   probably   search,   um,   or   sending   an   album   to   a   friend.   Um,   it   is,   it   is,   you   know,   even   like   new,   new   people   who   download   Google   Photos   after,   uh,   after   a   friend   shares.   Uh,   and   so   that   would   track   virality.   And   this   would   be,   you   know,   these-   these-   these   almost   track,   you   know,   almost   like   a   funnel,   um,   these   steps   that   I-   I   would   want   to   look,   look   at.   Uh,   and   these   would   guarantee   that   people   are   investing   more   time   in   the   product.   It's   not   simply   that   they're,   uh,   that   they're   opening   the   app   or   that   they're,   you   know,   looking   for   or   that   they're   passively   uploading   things.   They're   actively   invested   in   the   photo,   and   that's   the   difference   that   you   want   to   introduce   here.   And   then   from   a   more,   you   know,   so   these   are   the   actual   actions   and   then   from   a   more   lagging-   as   a   lagging   metric,   I   would   go   for   attention.   So   week   on   week,   um,   users   who   do   any   of   the,   you   know,   who   engage   basically,   do   any   of   the   actions   I-   I   listed   above,   is   this   number   going   up   or   down?   I   think   that's   how   I   would   determine,   uh,   whether   this   is   successful   or   not....   uh,   one   last   point,   maybe,   is   about   the   execution.   I   would   start   in   a,   maybe   in   a   single   country,   um,   test   for   a   couple   of   months,   keep   the   test   small,   and   see   the   results.   Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** Great.   Um,   thanks   for   this   great   mock   interview.   I   think   we   can   pause   here.   And   before   I   give   you   some   feedback,   I'd   love   to   hear   if   you   might   have   any,   um,   self-reflection   on   how   you   think   the   mock   interview   did   and   just   any   general   advice   and   tips   for   people   who   are   watching?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   thank   you.   Um,   let's   see.   I,   uh,   I   do   feel,   from   a   structure   perspective,   um,   uh,   I,   yeah,   I,   I,   I   almost   lost   sight   of   the   objective   here,   uh,   in   a   few,   in   a   few   spots,   and   I   think   I   spent   a   bit   too   much   time   just   going   into   details,   uh,   which   I'm   not   sure   were   very   relevant   to   just   answering   the   question.   Um,   so   there   was   a   loss   of   focus   in   a,   in,   in   a   few,   uh,   um,   at   a   few   moments.   Uh,   besides   that,   I   think   I,   I   finally   got   us   to   the   right   place.   I   don't   know   if   I   was   leading   enough   versus   being   led   by   your   questions,   so   I   was   a   bit   self-conscious   about   that.   Um,   yeah,   but   in   general,   I'm,   I'm   happy   with   my,   my   answer.  
**Interviewer:** Great.   Yeah,   I   definitely   felt   like   you   did   a   good   job   leading,   so   that's   a   good,   uh,   signal   there   for   you.   And   you   started   off   by   whiteboarding,   which   is   excellent,   especially   during   a   virtual   interview.   You   d-   talked   about   Port-   Porter's   Five   Forces,   use   cases,   you   tied   the   mission,   um,   into   the   problem   and   you   spoke   about   the   moats,   which   I   thought   was   really   important.   And   you   also   thought   about,   you   know,   you're   not   a   PM   at   Amazon,   but,   uh,   you   also   thought   about   what   Amazon,   potentially   if   you   put   yourself   in,   in   their   shoes,   what   they   might   do   to   create   a   moat   for   Amazon   Photos.   And,   uh,   one   thing   that   I   really   liked   was   that   you   called   out   privacy.   This   is   a   very   important   theme   for   Photos   and   I   was   very   happy   that   even   though   you   mentioned   a   social   feature,   you   did   call   out   that   privacy   was   important.   Um,   I,   I   think   that   just   one,   uh,   improvement   that   I   would   call   out   is,   or   maybe   two,   is   m-   m-   maybe   dive   a   little   bit   deeper   into   some   of   the   designs.   So   maybe   walk   me   through,   if   this   is   my   first   time   using   this   feature,   what   does   it   look   like?   Um,   you,   you   know,   I,   I'll   give   you   some   credit   here,   like,   you   definitely   gave   me   the   chance   to   say,   like,   "Hey,   like,   if,   if   we   have   time,   we   can   double-click   here."   So   you   definitely   gave   me   the   option   there   as   the   interviewer   to   look   at   that.   Um,   but   that's   one   piece   of   feedback.   And   then   the   second   and   last   one   is,   um,   even   though   this   is   just,   like,   a   mock   interview,   um,   if   this   were   a   real   interview,   I'm   sure   you   would   spend   some   more   time   maybe   pausing   and   asking,   uh,   some   more   questions   and   allowing   me   to,   uh,   just   make   sure   that   we're   on   the   same   page.  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   That's   great   feedback.   Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** All   in   all,   this   is   a   great,   great   mock   interview.   I'm   really   happy   to,   that   you   took   your   time   to   share   your   expertise   with   the   audience.   And   before   we   wrap   up,   do   you   have   any   final,   um,   advice   for   people   who   are   watching?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   I   was   thinking   about   that   today,   um,   reflecting   on   how   important   it   is   to,   uh,   get   to   the   point   where   it   feels   like   fun   to   just   do   these   interviews   or   to   just   prep   for   all   of   this.   Um,   but   yeah,   to,   to   keep   that   in   mind,   like,   if,   if   it's   not   fun   anymore,   maybe   there's   something   wrong   or,   you   know,   one   needs   to   take   a   break.   Um,   yeah,   I   think   it's   super   important.  
**Interviewer:** Definitely.   Wise   words.   Thanks   so   much.   And   for   the   audience   watching   at   home,   good   luck   with   your   upcoming   PM   interview.
