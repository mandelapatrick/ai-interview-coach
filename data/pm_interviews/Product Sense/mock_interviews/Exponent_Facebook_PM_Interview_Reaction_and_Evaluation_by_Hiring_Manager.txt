**Interviewer:** Hey,   everyone.   Um,   so   in   this   Exponent   video,   we're   going   to   try   something   a   little   bit   different.   I   will   be   reacting   to   one   of   the   previous   mock   interviews   that   we've   hosted   online.   Um,   we'll   be   picking   this   video   with   Selena,   um,   and   I'll   be   trying   to   give   some   analysis   and   feedback   throughout   the   video.   I   hope   you   enjoy   it.   (instrumental music)  
**Candidate:** ...   here   today.  
**Interviewer:** We're   super   excited   to   have   you   on   the   show,   Selena.   Um,   and   so   the   question,   the   mock   interview   question   that   we   will   be   doing   today   will   be,   how   would   you   design   a   product   around   movies   for   Facebook?  
**Candidate:** All   right,   product.  
**Interviewer:** And   so   ...   Yeah.   This   is   a   product   design   question,   uh,   interview   question.   Um,   and   it's   sort   of   open-ended,   but   yeah,   how,   let's   together   figure   out   a   product   that   we   would   design   around   movies   for   Facebook.  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   Sounds   good.   Um,   so   I   think   my   first   question   before   we   get   started   would   be,   is   this   a   product   you're   envisioning   existing   within   the   Facebook   app,   or   would   this   potentially   be   separate?  
**Interviewer:** It,   you   can   be   as   open-ended   as   you'd   like   with   this   question.   So   yeah,   feel   free   to   operate   within   the   Facebook   app.   I   would   con,   the   constraint   is   just   that   it's   something   that   Facebook   itself   as   a   company   would   launch.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Um,   one   more   question.   What   do   you   think   about   hardware   versus   software?   I   know   Portal   is   a   big   bet   for   Facebook,   so   do   we   want   to   maybe   think   on   a   hardware   lens   as   well?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   That's   a   great   question.  
**Candidate:** Not   a   literal   lens,   like   hardware   direction.   (laughs)  
**Interviewer:** (laughs)   That's   a   great   question.   So   yeah,   the   question   being,   is   there   a   hardware   angle   here?   You   can   certainly   brainstorm   in   that   direction   if   you'd   like   to.   Um,   you're   not   constrained   by   that.  
**Candidate:** Okay.  
**Interviewer:** So   one   thing   that   Selena's   doing   really   well   here   is   that   she's   taking   the   time   to   ask   clarifying   questions.   Uh,   right   off   the   bat,   one   huge   mistake   that   we   see   with   most   interviewing,   um,   is   that   people   forget   to   actually   ask   these   follow-up   questions.   The   interview   is   a   conversation   between   you   and   the   interviewer.   It's   not   a   one   directional   speech   or   proposal.   And   so   what   Selena's   doing   is   she's   trying   to   scope   out   the   problem   to   understand   what   room   she   has   to   play   with   in   this   interview.   And   then   next   what   she'll   do   is   she'll   actually   take   the   time   to   pause   and   to   collect   her   thoughts   and   write   down   some   ideas.   This   is   also   super   critical,   um,   is   not   only   asking   the   question   to   understand   the   problem,   but   taking   the   time   to   actually   collect   your   thoughts   so   that   you   can   have   a   well-delivered   answer   when   you're   ready   to   actually,   um,   give   it   in   the   interview.  
**Candidate:** Awesome.   So   I   think   the   way   that   I'd   like   to   go   about   this,   um,   first   I'll   talk   a   little   bit   about   Facebook's   mission   and   strategy   and   why   we   might   be   interested   in   getting   into   a   movie   product.   Um,   from   there,   I'll   do   a   customer   segmentation   and   prioritize   one,   and   then   we'll   do   a   quick   brainstorm   about   potential   pain   points   and   needs,   um,   prioritize   one   of   those,   and   then   from   there   we'll   come   up   with   a   few   solutions   and   we'll,   we'll   evaluate   on   impact   and   maybe   a   couple   other   key   metrics   to   pick   one.   And   then   I'll   walk   you   through   how   I   think   I   would   do   an   MVP.   Does   that   sound   good?  
**Interviewer:** Sounds   great.   Thanks   for   mapping   it   out.  
**Candidate:** Awesome.   So   I'm   just   gonna   take   a   quick   second   to   jot   down   my   thoughts   here.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome.   Take   your   time.   So   before   we   get   into   the   answer,   I   also   want   to   comment   on   something   that   Selena's   done   really   effectively   here,   which   is   she's   actually   laid   out   a   map   of   how   she's   gonna   go   about   answering   this   question.   It's   super,   super   critical   to   give   your   interviewer   a   sense   of,   hey,   this   is   my   general   approach.   Um,   this   would   be   a   perfect   time   if   I   didn't   agree   with   that   structure   or   if   I   had   envisioned   a   different   way   of   going   about   this   interview   question,   um,   that   I   could   jump   in   there   and   give   Selena   some   guidance   or   some   direction   on   it.   Um,   but   what's   been   really   effective   right   now   is   that   she's   stated   that   upfront   so   I   have   the   right   expectations   going   in   and   I   sort   of   have   this   mental   map   as   I   go   through   the   interview   with   Selena.  
**Candidate:** All   right.   So   Facebook's   mission   is   to   connect   the   world   and   bring   people   closer   together   and   to   give   people   a   platform   to   express   themselves   about   the   things   that   they   care   about.   So   it   totally   makes   sense   to   me   as   to   why   we   would   be   interested   in   moving   further   into   the   movie   space.   I   think   movies   and   cinema   and   entertainment   in   general   is   something   that   people   have   used   to   connect   together,   um,   since   mo-   movies   were   invented,   and   I   think   it   has   really   global   appeal.   It   doesn't   matter   where   you're   from,   pretty   much   everyone   enjoys,   um,   getting   together   with   friends   and   families   and   broader   social   communities   around   movies.   Um,   and   also   I   think   Facebook   is   making   a   lot   of   big   bets   in   the   general   video   realm.   So   on   Facebook   Watch,   I   know   there's   a   big   push   to   really   make   Facebook   a   home   for   entertainment   and   not   just   that,   that   social   use   case,   but   that   you   would   actually   be   going   to   the   app   specifically   to,   to   be   entertained   in   your   downtime.   Um,   I   know   thinking   about   the   platform,   Instagram   TV   also   pursuing   a   similar   approach,   um,   to   really   provide   a   hub   for   all   of   that   types   of   content.   So   I   think   there's   the   division   also   between,   there's   creator   content   and   then   there's   kind   of   more   premium,   uh,   kind   of   produced   content.   So   movies   to   me   would   maybe   sit   within   there.   I   think   we   could   talk   about,   you   know,   what   does   it   mean   to   be   a   movie?   Does   that   necessarily   predicate   it's   coming   from   Hollywood   or,   or   wherever,   or,   um,   would   we   include   maybe   creator   movies   and   individual   movies   within   that?   Um,   yeah,   overall   I   think   that   movies   is   something   that's   important   to   think   about.   Um,   there   are   some   competitors   in   this   space.   I   think   Netflix   would   be   the   first   one   that   comes   to   mind,   and   it's   crowded.   I   mean,   Amazon   offers   movies   as   well,   Hulu.   Um,   so   I   want   to   think   about   how   can   we   offer   something   that's   really   differentiated.  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.   Yeah,   and   ...   So   what   is   Selena   doing   here?   She's   starting   off   the   interview   by   actually   talking   a   little   bit   more   about   Facebook's   mission,   how   it   ties   into   Facebook's   competitive   landscape,   and   just   some   philosophy   around   what   are   movies   and   how   do   they   contribute   to   the   ecosystem   at   Facebook.   Um,   this   is   what   makes   a   interview   stand   out   as   someone   from   maybe   a   more   senior   interviewing   perspective,   is   that   they   can   come   in   and   talk   a   little   bit   more   high   level,   um,   and   bring   in   some   of   this   knowledge   on   how   this   particular   product   development   and   this   product   exercise   that   we'll   do   in   this   interview   will   tie   in   to   the   broader,   um,   landscape   for   the   company.   Um,   one   super   effective   tip   here   is   just   always,   always,   always   mentioning   the   mission   and   using   that   mission   to   prioritize   decisions   that   are   made   later   down   the   line   in   this   interview.   Um,   so   o-one   other   quick   thing   is   that   Selena's   also   done   really   effectively   is   she's   stated   her   opinion   here.   She's   also   left   a   pause   for   me   as   an   interviewer   to   jump   in,   to   direct   her,   to   give   some   feedback,   um,   avoiding   the   sort   of,   uh,   rambling   problem   that   happens   in   a   lot   of   interviews   as   well.And   on   that   note,   like,   I   suppose,   what,   what,   what   do   you   think   you'd   lean   into   when   you   think   about   the   com-   competition   to   Facebook?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   So   I   would   say   what   is   Facebook's   strength   that,   that   these   other   providers   don't   have,   and   that   to   me   is   really   the   social   graph.   The   power   of   that   connection   between   friends   and   family,   um,   enables   you   to,   uh,   unlock   so   much   more   value   both   in   the   watching   experience,   but   also   in   terms   of   content   recommendation.   So   I   would   say   that   would   be   the   angle   that   I   would   want   to   really   emphasize   here   to,   uh,   help   us   provide   something   that   people   would   really   be   excited   about.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome.   Cool.   So   Celina's   now   answered   about   competition,   and   this   is   a   follow-up   question,   and   you'll   be   asked   lots   of   these   throughout   the   interview   that'll   sort   of   push   you   in   different   directions.   Um,   in   this   one,   she   had   a   good   answer   on   what   the   comparative   advantage   is.   Whenever   thinking   about   competitors,   what   is   it   that   Facebook   has   that   our   competitors   don't?   So   when   you   think   about   a   Netflix,   for   example,   the   social   graph   certainly   stands   out.   Um,   what   I   wish   I   would   have   heard   here   a   little   bit   more,   um,   is   a   little   bit   more   of   an   analysis   or   conversation   around   the   actual   competitors.   Like,   who   are   these   competitors?   Um,   what   are   they   doing   and   what's   their   strategy,   and   why   would   social   sort   of   beat   out   the   other   competitors   in   this   particular   space?   So   I   think   there   could   have   been   maybe   a   richer   discussion   around   the   competitors   and   analyzing   them.   Um,   and   really,   when   talking   about   competitors   in   these   interviews,   it   always   just   starts   from   understanding.   Um,   so   it's   like   let's   understand   what   is   Netflix   doing?   What   are,   what   are   these   other   players   doing?   Um,   and   what   do   we   have   an   opportunity   to   do?  
**Candidate:** So   now   I'm   gonna   do   a   quick   customer   segmentation.  
**Interviewer:** Cool.  
**Candidate:** All   right,   so   the   way   that   I   see   it,   um,   in   terms   of   segmentation   for   a   movie   product,   I   feel   like   there's   two   big   buckets.   On   the   one   hand,   there   are   creators,   and   on   the   other   hand,   there's   viewers.   So   digging   a   little   bit   deeper   on   the   creator   side,   I   felt   like   there   were   three   constituencies.   Um,   there's   a   professional   creator   vertical,   which   includes   kind   of   major   professional,   like   Hollywood-type,   you   know,   major   motion   films.   Um,   then   I   would   say   there's   kind   of   professional   influencer.   Um,   I   think   longer   form   content   you   don't   necessarily   think   of   as,   like,   the   same   types   of   influencers   on   Instagram,   so   maybe   that's   more   of   like   indie   film   creators,   not,   not   quite   on   the   same   level   as,   like,   Hollywood.   Um,   and   then   on   the   viewer   side,   I   thought   I   could   bucket   that   maybe   around   usage,   like   high   usage   and   low   usage.   So   I   think,   you   know,   what   is   our   goal   here,   um,   you   know,   is   creating   a   movie   product   for   Facebook.   Is   there   any   more   specific   goal   you   want   me   to   focus   on   when   I   prioritize   here?   Otherwise,   I   would   probably   prioritize   on,   uh,   scale   or   scope   and   impact,   so   basically   how   many   potential   users   are   in   here   and,   uh,   which   segment   do   we   think   maybe   might   be   most   impactful   to,   to   work   for?  
**Interviewer:** That   sounds   like   a   great   call.   You   can   go   with,   run   with   that.   Yeah.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   So   I   think   the   one   that   stands   out   to   me,   um,   would   maybe   be   on   the   creator   side,   and   I'm   actually...   I   think   I   missed   one   of   my   buckets   here,   which   was,   uh,   a   third   type   of   creator,   which   is   a   everyday   person   who   might   wanna   create   a   movie.   Um,   and   I   think   I   wanna   go   in   that   direction,   and   here's   why.   It's   specifically   around   that,   um,   kind   of   competitive   advantage   around   the   social   graph.   I   feel   like   you   could   leverage   that   to   make   the   creator   experience   of   actually   making   a   movie   a   more   social   experience.   I   haven't   fully   fleshed   out   how   that   might   be   the   case,   but   to   me,   that   feels   like   right   now   when   you   create   content,   it's   siloed.   Either   you're   alone   on   your   phone   or   you're,   like,   a   fully   professional   person   with   a   whole   team.   But   is,   is   there   some,   is   there   some   way   that   we   can   unlock   that   creative   experience   that's   more   social?  
**Interviewer:** Hmm.   Got   it.   Yeah,   super   interesting.   So,   um,   you're   sort   of   thinking   about,   like,   the   creative   experience   being   a   social   one   basically?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** Like...   Yeah.   Got   it.  
**Candidate:** And   I   think   if   we   look   about   the   scope   of,   of,   um,   this   segmentation,   if   we   consider,   um,   pretty   much   any   user   that   has   created   some   sort   of   video   content   in   the   past   and   maybe   take   a   percentage   of   those   that   have   not   yet   that   might   be   pulled   into   the   market   with   this   product,   um,   I   think   that   actually   has   a   very   large   scope   compared   to   the   other   cre-   creator   sides   which   are   more,   um,   kind   of   concentrated   within   influencers   or   seriously   concentrated   in,   like,   uh,   Fox   and   Sony   and   those   types   of   places.  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.   Got   it.   Makes   sense.   So   Celina's   done   something   really   effective   here.   Um,   first   off,   we're   in   the   user   segmentation   part   of   a   product   sense   or   product   design   interview.   Um,   always   really,   really   important   to   take   the   time   to   think   about,   um,   what   users   are   we   targeting   with   this   product   development.   The   narrower   the   user   segment   and   the   more   specific   we   get,   the   better   the   product   can   be   because   it's   more   precise   targeting   those   specific   sets   of   users.   So   Celina   runs   through   a   few   options.   She   also   asks   me   again,   what   are   the   goals   of   this   product   and   are   there   any   goals?   But   she   asks   it   in   a   way   such   that   she   still   has   an   answer   if   I   don't   answer   that   question.   Um,   that's   something   really,   really   effective   in   interviews   is   saying,   "Hey,   this   is   where   I   want   to   go.   Um,   let   me   know   if   you   have   an   opinion   on   a   different   direction   or   let   me   know   if   there's,   um,   a   different   approach   that   you'd   like   me   to   take   here."   Um,   so   she's   done   that   really   effectively.   She's   stated   it   and   enumerated   the   segments.   That's   always   super   helpful   is   saying   like,   "Hey,   there   are   three   segments   here."   We   sort   of   lost   it   a   little   bit,   um,   toward   the   end   because   then   she   added   a   second...   uh,   another   one   at   the   end.   Um,   and   so   I,   I   think   a   summary   could   have   been   helpful   here   where   Celina's   like,   "Hey,   these   are   the   user   segments   that   I   picked,"   um,   just   because   it's   always,   uh,   kind   of   hard,   especially   on   video   to   hear,   uh,   the   enumeration.   And   it's   always   helpful   to   kind   of   repeat   it   over   and   over   again.   Um,   but   regardless,   feeling   excited   about   the   different   segments   that   Celina's   come   up   with.   Um,   there's   definitely   some   justification   for   ones   that   she's   sort   of   biasing   towards   here,   um,   which   is   always   really,   really   helpful   as   well.   So   sort   of   stating   a   few   ideas   and   then   stating   your   preference   upon   those   ideas   that   were   just   stated.   Um,   let's   see   how   she   goes   from   here.  
**Candidate:** Um,   are   you   okay   with   that   direction?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   That   sounds   good.   I,   I'd   love   to   hear   maybe   just   like   one   quick   thing,   um,   about   maybe   one   of   the   other   customer   segments   and   why   you   didn't   pick   that   one.
**Candidate:** Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** Take   a   pick   at   that,   yeah.  
**Candidate:** So,   I   thought   about   the   viewer   side   as   well.   I,   this   is   really   like   a   two-sided   marketplace   to   me.   You   have   the   creation   and   then   you   have   the   viewing.   Um,   but   I   think   right   now,   uh,   Facebook   Watch   already   has   pretty   good   UI   in   terms   of   viewing,   and   I   think   we   can   leverage   that.   Um,   and   h-   we   have   really   good   kind   of   social   features   around   if   you're   watching   together,   you   can   comment   or   react   and   you   can   see   the   reactions   going   by,   and   I   think   that   that   is   a   great   start.   Um,   I   think   that's   exciting,   but   to   me,   it's   much   more   a   kind   of   zero   to   one   unmet   need   around   that   social   side   that   I   don't   feel   is   being   served   right   now-  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.  
**Candidate:** ...   on   the   creator   side.  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.   Yeah,   I   think   that's   a,   a   great   innovative   perspective,   which   is   that   socialness,   you   know,   naively   might   come   from   the   viewer's   perspective,   from   someone   looking   at   this   problem,   but   there's   actually   a   way   to   add   a   socialness   to   the   creator's   perspective.   So   I'm   curious   to   see   what   we   come   up   with.  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   Okay,   so   I'm   going   to   take   a   minute   now   to   brainstorm   some   pain   points   that   creators   would   have   around   it   being   maybe   not   that   social   in   the   creative   process.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome.   Take   your   time.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   so   I've   thought   of   four   pain   points,   um,   around   the   whole   creation   process,   uh,   being   not   social,   and   so   what   are   some   pain   points   that   people   experience   by   creating   alone?   Um,   the   first   one   is   wondering,   is   my   idea   any   good?   So,   is,   is   the   overall   theme   that   I'm   approaching   my   script   or   the,   just   the   general   pitch   of   my   movie,   is   that   something   that   is   interesting   and   valuable   to   people?   I   think   that's   something   that   could   be   really   hard   if   you're   in   your   own   personal   mental   echo   chamber   to   know.   And   if   you   make   a   movie   that   no   one's   interested   in,   you   basically   wasted   all   your   time.  
**Interviewer:** Mm-hmm.  
**Candidate:** Um,   so   that's   the   first   one.   The   next   one   is   maybe   that   it's   a   lonely   experience.   I   think   this   one   especially   came   to   mind   given   we   are   in   socially   distanced   times   right   now.  
**Interviewer:** Yep.  
**Candidate:** But   that   I   see   a   ton   of   people   on   my   feed,   you   know,   recording   themselves   alone   in   their   various   places.   So,   is   there   some   way   to   make   that   recording   process   a   little   bit   more   communal?   Um,   I   know   a   lot   of   movies   are   even   trying   to   be   recorded   via   Zoom   right   now.   Like,   this   interview   itself   is   being   recorded   via   Zoom   right   now.  
**Interviewer:** Mm-hmm.  
**Candidate:** So,   i-   is   there   some   way   we   can,   um,   make   that   a   more,   more   communal   experience?   Um,   the   next   one   was   around   like,   okay,   maybe   I   lack   all   the   skills   needed   to   get   my   movie   to   full   fruition.   So,   maybe   I'm   really   great   at   filming,   but   I'm   not   good   at   acting.   Or   maybe   I'm   great   at   script   writing   or   sound   editing,   but,   um,   not,   not   the   next   step.   So,   is   there   a   way   to,   to   bring   in   more   people   with   more   skills   somehow?   Um,   and   then   last   one,   this   was   around   maybe,   like,   can   my   audience   be   bigger?   Like,   as   one   person,   I   only   have   a   certain   amount   of   reach   in   terms   of,   um,   my,   my   general   population   that   I   can   reach   out   to   of   friends   and   family   and   my   network.   So,   is,   is   there   an   opportunity   to   leverage   more   people   to   bring   that   bigger   audience   and   make   the   movie   more   of   a   success?  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.   This   is   an   awesome   list.   Um,   yeah,   what-   what   are   you   sort   of   thinking   are   the   priorities   here   with   the   pain   points?   So,   Selena's   now   gone   into   the   pain   points   part   of   this   process.   So   she's   talking   about,   um,   given   a   user   segment   that   we   want   to   explore,   what   are   the   pain   points   that   that   user   experiences   a   lot?   Done   a   super   effective   job   of   enumerating   them,   done   a   super   effective   job   of   diving   into   each   one   while   also   giving   space   if   I   wanted   to   ask   follow-up   questions,   um,   to   dig   into   them   further.   Uh,   with   this   part   of   the   process,   um,   it's   always   really,   really   important   to   just   empathize   with   the   user.   What   are   the   actual   pain   points   and   problems?   Selena   brings   in   some   of   the   more   social   distancing   norms   and,   um,   that   sort   of   thing   that   makes   it   more   contemporary.   Um,   and   in   general,   it's   always   helpful   to   kind   of   think   about   different   nuances   or   perspectives,   um,   that   you   might   be   bringing   into   the   interview   that   are   novel   or   creative   or   insightful   here.  
**Candidate:** So,   I   think   I   really   want   to   measure,   like,   impact   to   goal.   So,   if   our   goal   is,   you   know,   to   make   a   movie   product   for   Facebook   that   is   inherently   social,   which   one   do   we   believe   will   have   the   most   impact?   Um,   so   I   would   s-   probably   try   to   see   which   one   is   the   biggest   pain.   Um,   so   looking   through,   I   think   there's   definitely   some   immediacy   around   the   loneliness   of   creating,   and   I   think   this   one's   differentiated   too   because   most   of   the   ways   that   individual   people   create   video   for   social   media   is   with,   like,   the,   the   front-facing   cam,   like,   is   in   itself   a,   a   lonely   experience.   So,   that   one   to   me   feels   highly   impactful   to   this   goal.   Um,   let   me   see.   And   I   think   another   one   that   stands   out   is,   like,   can   my   audience   be   bigger?   I   think   there   actually   might   be   an   opportunity   to   tie   those   two   together,   um,   if,   if   you're   doing   this   in   a   more   social   way   'cause   there   may   be   a,   as   an   end   point   that   the   audience   would   be   magnified   as   a   result.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   Yeah,   I   think,   I,   I   really   thought   the   lonely   experience   one   was   interesting   'cause   it's   kind   of   a   not   thought   about   problem,   but   definitely   true.   And,   uh,   yeah,   particularly   presently   a   problem   for   this   day.   So,   yeah.  
**Candidate:** Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** I'm   curious   about   that   one.  
**Candidate:** I   think   it's   interesting   'cause   it's   in-   it's   almost   inherent   in   the   workflow   today   of   how,   how   video   exists.   So-  
**Interviewer:** Mm-hmm.  
**Candidate:** ...   that   to   me   signals   that   there's   maybe   a   new   way   to,   to   think   about   it   that   could   be   really   additive.  
**Interviewer:** Definitely.  
**Candidate:** Um,   to   mention   one   that   I   didn't   pick,   so   lacking   skills.   I   think   that   that's   an   interesting   one.   That   to   me   feels   a   little   bit   outside   of   Facebook's   wheelhouse.   Um,   I   would   expect   that   that's   more   on   the,   like,   Final   Cut   Pro,   um,   maybe   Reddit   boards   or   w-   wherever   creatives   go   to,   to   meet   up   and   co-   collaborate   together.   And   I   think   that,   um,   probably   it   would   be   better   served   to   focus   more   on   that   in   essence   of   socialness   in   itself.  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.   Yeah.   That   makes   sense.   So,   now   Selena's   prioritizing   these   pain   points   so   that   we   can   come   up   with   a   product   design   that   we're   happy   with   later.   Um,   one   thing   that   Selena's   doing   really   effectively   is   she's   prioritizing   against   the   goal   that   we   stated   in   the   beginning   of   the   problem.   It's   always   really   effective   to   bring   that   back   into   the   problem,   um,   and   to   rethink   that.   What's   also   effective   is   that   it's   clear   Selena's   not   using   a   framework.   She's   not   saying,   "Hey,   this   is   my,   um,   you   know,   analysis   or   my   pro/con   list   or   anything   like   that."   She's   making   persuasive   arguments   for   why   we   should   consider   one   of   these   pain   points   or   the   other.   One   is   a   competitive   argument,   another   is   maybe   a   goal-based   argument....   and   these   are   really,   really   effective,   um,   to   have   a   rich   conversation.   Um,   you   can   see   that   there   was   even   a   little   bit   of   riffing   between   me   and   Selena   in   this   interview.   Um,   the   interviewer   in   this   room   is   excited   to   have   a   rich,   creative,   fun   conversation   with   you.   So,   um,   it's   really   effective   to   actually   have   this,   uh,   thoughtful   dialogue   about   it   and   kind   of   bounce   back   and   forth   with   your   interviewer   and   have   that   energy.   That's   something   that   great   product   managers   are   always   really   great   at   as   well   on   product   teams.  
**Candidate:** So   we're   gonna   focus   on   this   I'm   lonely,   and   maybe   we'll   see   if   the   audience   can   be   brought   in   as   a   result.   But   really,   the,   the   main   pain   point   is   the   loneliness   here.   Okay,   so   I   will   take   a   minute   now   to   brainstorm   some   solutions   for   this.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   so   I've   thought   of   three   potential   solutions   here.   Um,   the   first   one   is   something   we   could   probably   MVP   via   groups,   but   this   would   be   around   creating   creative   groups   for   moral   support   kind   of   throughout   the   movie   process.   So,   um,   you   could   join   this   particular   subset   and   let   people   know   about   your   general   project   timeline,   and   they   could   kind   of   check   in   with   you   and   give   you   kudos   and   be   a   sounding   board   for   ideas   as   you   move   on.   And   I   could   see   this   being   really   beneficial   to   also   have,   like,   networking   between   creatives,   um,   so   that   if   you're   part   of   this   group,   then   you   can,   um,   more   easily   work   together   in   the   future   and   kind   of   percolate   from   the   hive   mind   of,   of   creative   ideas.   Um,   the   next   idea   I   had   was,   uh,   this   new   feature   for   Portal   called   Portal   Audience.   So   this   would   be   a   way   to   really   quickly   get   viewers   earlier   on   in   the   creative   process.   So   if   you're   recording   via   Portal,   uh,   people   could   just   join   in   and   drop   in   and   see   what   you're   up   to   and   you   can   talk   to   them.   Um,   but   they   would   be   kind   of   like   a   one-to-many.   Um,   I   think   there's   some   privacy   concerns   there.   We   could   talk   about   how   we   could   set   up   those   features.   But,   um,   that   could   be   a   fun   way   to   kind   of   get,   get   more   people   in,   in   your   creative   room.   And   the   last   idea,   so   this   one   is   a   little   bit   out   there,   but   I   think   there's   an   opportunity   to   maybe,   like,   create   a   movie   together   through   Facebook.   So,   um,   I   got   this   idea   through,   like,   the   moments   that   you   can   share,   like,   with   your   friends   when   it's   your   friendversary   and   they,   you   can   create   a   movie   of   your   friendship.   So   what   if   we   went   even   a   step   further   with   that   and   we   made   it   so   that   you   could   create   an   actual   recording   movie   with   your   friends   and   film   each   scene   and   kind   of   hand   it   off?   So   you   could   even   do   it   asynchronously   and   kind   of   slowly   create   a   movie   over   time.   Mm,   I'm   thinking   even   further   about   this   now.   Maybe   it   could   be   like,   you   know   the   movie   Boyhood,   how   they   kind   of   record   little   snippets?   Like,   uh,   I   don't   know   if   it's   a   minute   a   day,   but   just   over   his   whole   life.   So   maybe   you   could   make   the   video   of   your   life   on   Facebook.   I   think   that   would   align   really   well   with,   um,   the   rest   of   the   platform   having,   um,   your   memories   over   time  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   super   interesting.   And   so   for   that   last   idea,   like,   it's   sort   of...   I   would   love   to   hear   a   little   bit   more   kind   of   what,   what   you're   imagining   and,   and   I   guess   also   hearing   your   preference   on   which   one   you   want   to   dive   into   and   which   one,   um,   sounds   exciting   in   terms   of   moving   forward.  
**Candidate:** I   think-  
**Interviewer:** So   now,   um,   Selena's   coming   up   with   solutions   to   the   pain   points.   Um,   this   is   always   one   of   the   more   creative   and   fun   and   brainstormy   parts   of   the   product   management   interviews,   and   personally   one   of   my   favorites,   because   we're   coming   up   with   a   ton   of   different   ideas   that   we   think   could   solve   this   problem.   So   a   couple   things   that   Selena's   done   really   effectively   here,   she's,   uh,   mentioned   problems   and   then   also   mentioned   a   little   bit   of   caveats.   She   had   that   point   about   privacy   concerns,   and   sort   of,   uh,   flagging   it   or   bookmarking   it   for   a   later   discussion   in   case   that's   something   that   I   was   concerned   about   and   in   case   we   go   through   with   that   idea.   She's   also   done   something   really   effective   here   by   saying,   "Hey,   this   one's   really   out   there.   This   is   kind   of   a,   a   crazy   idea,   but,"   um,   and   sort   of   caveating   that   and   giving   a   sense   to   the   interviewer   that,   "Hey,   I   know   this   idea   is   out   there,   but   here's   an   idea   that   shows   that   I   can   kind   of   think   about   those   moonshot   ideas   or   think   about   these   kind   of   really   pie-in-the-sky   ideas   that   could   be   really   exciting   visions   that   we   then,   uh,   maybe   make   small   steps   towards   in   this   interview."   So   I   think   she's   done   a   really   effective   job   with   that.   Um,   and   then   lastly,   I   just   think   Selena's   showing   clear   passion   and   enthusiasm,   especially   for   that   last   idea,   which   we'll   dig   into   a   little   bit   deeper   in   the   rest   of   this   interview.  
**Candidate:** I   think   I   am   excited   about   this   last   one   as   I'm   thinking   about   it   more.   I   think   really   it   aligns   well,   um,   both   on   the   social   experience   with   being   able   to   create   something   together,   but   also-  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.  
**Candidate:** ...   and   Facebook's   bread   and   butter,   which   is,   you   know,   kind   of   collecting,   um,   memories   and   moments,   uh,   between   you   and   your   friends   and   family.   So   I,   I   think   that's   the   one   I   want   to   go   with.   I,   I   think,   you   know,   to   put   metrics   around   it,   it   would   be,   like,   impact.   I   might   think   about   effort   as   well.   I   think   this   one   is   probably   a   little   higher   effort   than   creating   groups   for   moral   support,   for   example.   But   I   think   the   impact   would   be   super,   super   high,   um,   on   making   movies   a   more   inclusive,   social   creative   process,   and   maybe   potentially   impact   a   lot   of   people's   lives   for   the   better   if   they   are   able   to   kind   of   chronicle   their   life   over   time,   um,   and   everyone   could   have   their   own   personal   movie.   That   could   be   very   rewarding   and   special.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   totally.   And   I   mean,   there's   a   lot   of   interesting   thought   there,   just   like   even   the   statement   you   just   said   about   everyone   having   their   own   personal   movie   and   like   what   that   even   means   for   people   and   how   they   view   their   lives.   Um,   but   yeah,   I'm   curious,   like,   yeah,   tell   me   a   little   bit   more   about   kind   of   what   you're   imagining   in   this   experience,   and   I   would   love   to   just   maybe   poke   out   some   of   the   features   or   hear   a   little   bit   about   what   the   high   priority   features   would   be.  
**Candidate:** Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** So   before   we   go   into   feature   development   and   picking   features,   um,   there   is   something   interesting   about   this   solution,   right?   Um,   it's   not   quite   what   you   might   think   a   movie   would   be   necessarily.   Um,   when   I   think   about   movies,   (coughs)   I   would   think   about   movies   as   more,   um,   cinematic   experiences   or   directed   experiences.   And   so   I   can   imagine   a   viewer   watching   this   or   an   interviewer   watching   this   being   like,   "Hey,   that's   not   exactly   what   I   asked.   That's   not   the   direction   I   want   to   go   in."   I   was   sort   of   happy   with   this   direction,   um,   because   it   sort   of   expands   the   definition   of   what   a   movie   is,   and   it   feels   creative   and   exciting.   And   so   I   want   to   make   sure   you   as   a   viewer   know   that   when   you're   going   through   these   interviews,   it's   okay   to   kind   of   veer   off   the   path   or   go   into   a   pocket   of   the   question   that   maybe   didn't   seem   like   the   original   intent   of   the   interview.   Um,   mostly   because   this   process   is   a   creative   one,   it's   a   back   and   forth.   The   interviewer   is   there   not   to   assess   if   you   can   follow   the   deadline   or   follow   the   guidelines   of   sort   of   the   exact   parameters   of   the   question,   but   it's   more   about......   creating   something   together   in   this   interview,   and   that's   what   makes   these   interviews   so   fun.   So,   um,   let's   see   where   Selena   goes   with   that   particular   direction.  
**Candidate:** Absolutely.   So   I   think   this   would   be   ...   probably   it   could   live   under,   uh,   cr-   cre-   creating   a   video   post   in   the   near   term,   and   it   could   ask   you,   like,   "Oh,   do   you   wanna   add   this   to   your   movie?"   So   actually,   maybe   it   could   be   super,   super   lean   whenever   you're,   like,   sharing   a   story   or   something.   Instead   of   kind   of   collecting   it   to   memories,   it   could   say,   "Do   you   wanna   add   this   to   your   movie?"   and   that   could   be   the   first   discovery   point.   And   then   it   could   explain   like,   yeah,   you   know,   just   collecting   movie   over   the   course   of   your   life.   I   think   there   could   be   a   separate   entry   point   within   Facebook   Watch   if   you're   like,   I'm   a   more   real   deal   video   creator,   and   I'm   gonna   have   my   army   of   socially   distant   creators   to   make   this   amazing   thriller.   I   don't   know.   Um,   and   so   then   you   could   go   to   Watch   specifically,   and   I   think   then   there   would   be   probably   some   sort   of,   like,   of   the   video   pop   up,   and   you   could   hit   record.   Um,   there   probably   need   to   be   some   really   basic   editing,   just   probably   trimming   on   the   ends   initially.   I   don't   think   we   need   to   get   too   far   into   kind   of   more   mechanics   of   effects   and   sound   editing   at   the   initial   point.   Um-  
**Interviewer:** Sure.  
**Candidate:** ...   and   then   there's   probably   something   of,   like,   tagging   people   in   the   project.   So,   you   could   probably   add   people   in   and   remove   them.   I   could   see   if   someone's   just   doing   a   little   moment,   maybe   you   don't   want   them   in   there   the   whole   time.   Um,   and   then   there's   somewhere   you'd   need   a   database   to   store   all   of   these   movies.   If   this   is   longer   form   content,   then   y-   there's   definitely   storage   that   we   need   to   think   about.   Um,   and   then   maybe   it's   like,   do   you   have,   like,   a   publish   versus   still   editing   mode?   I   think   definitely.   So   there   probably   needs   to   be   some   sort   of,   like,   my   library   of,   of   existing   in-process   movies   and   ones   that   are   already   published.  
**Interviewer:** Definitely.   Um,   I'm   curious,   like,   so,   you   know,   and,   and   maybe   the,   the   answer   sort   of   is   baked   into   my   question,   but,   um,   YouTube   is   obviously   a   place   also   for   people   to   upload   and,   and   brainstorm   and   create   some   of   these,   like,   maybe   lower   fidelity   or,   or   sort   of,   like,   lighter   weight   videos   and   movie   experiences.   Um,   so   Facebook's   like   ...   in   this   world   that   Facebook   is   creating,   like,   how   will   you   really   leverage   some   of   the   social   stuff   to   really   differentiate   it   from   YouTube?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   I   think   it's   really   about,   like,   tagging   other   people   to   be   able   to   add   one   of   their   videos   to   your,   your   life   movie   or   your   thriller.   I   think   both   can   work.   Um,   and   yeah,   maybe   you   can   even   have   people   as   contributors   over   time.   So   I   think   with   YouTube,   right,   you   finish   something,   you   upload   it,   that's   it.   Um,   maybe   there's   a   little   bit   of   editing   you   can   do.   Versus   this   is   kind   of   a   continuous,   ongoing   project   that,   again,   can   be   asynchronous,   that   you   can   tag   your   friends   and   do   it,   do   it   later   in   little   chunks   that   measure   up   to   something   really   big   and   meaningful.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   Yeah,   it   sounds   like   we're   almost   inventing   a   new   type   of   content   in   general,   like,   that   doesn't   really   exist   right   now,   but,   like,   what   if   we   can   make   these   movie   experiences   that   were   both   living   and   social   in   the   way   that   they   were   created   and   added   to?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** So-  
**Candidate:** I   love   that.   Living   is   the   exact   word.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   (laughs)   Yeah,   I'm   curious,   like,   for   you   also,   like,   so   what,   what   are   some   w-   worries   that   you   have   about   this?   Like   ...   So   before   we   get   into   the   worries   and   we   talk   a   little   bit   more   about,   um,   uh,   how   Selena   might   think   about   this,   I,   I   would   say   this   part   of   the   interview   felt,   uh,   the   most   weak   to   me   when   we   actually   analyze   it.   Um,   Selena   started   off   by,   uh,   stating   a   few   different   parts   or   features   of   this   problem,   but   it   didn't   really   come   with   a   structure   at   all.   Um,   she   sort   of   felt   like   it   was,   like,   uh,   listing   a   bunch   of   ideas.   Um,   it   ...   That   could   have   been   effective   if   Selena   had   said   something   like,   "Hey,   I'm   gonna   brainstorm   some   ideas.   I'm   just   gonna   throw   things   against   the   wall.   We're   gonna   see   what   sticks   and   then   I'll   pick   the   ones   that   I   think   are   the   most   favorite."   That   would   have   been   an   effective   way   to   go   about   that,   um,   and   not   actually   adding   that   much   more   structure   to   it,   but   just   sort   of   allowing   her   to   have   the   space   to   play   and   to   come   up   with   these   ideas.   Uh,   but   since   we   didn't   do   that,   I,   as   an   interviewer,   I   felt   a   little   lost   in   where   we   were   going   with   it   and   what   the   most   important   features   were,   and   ...   Um,   it   is   a   very   big   problem,   so   it's   hard   to   pick   which   single   feature   would   be   the   most   important.   Um,   what   I   wish   Selena   might   have   done   is,   uh,   you   know,   in   addition   to   maybe   the   brainstorm   part   of   it,   is   again   bring   up   the   goals   of   the   product   and   the,   the   feature   and   tie   it   back   there.   So   it's   like,   hey,   our   goal   is   to   reduce,   uh,   loneliness   in   the   process,   or,   you   know,   Facebook's   mission,   um,   is   this.   And   that's   how   we'll   think   about   which   feature   is   the   most   critical   to   launch   and   how   we   might   go   about   launching   it.   Um,   so   I   ...   Definitely   taking   the   time   also   to,   to   come   up   with   these   ideas   and   to   think   through   the   structure   and   to   think   about   answering   it,   um,   this   is   one   of   the   parts   of   the   interview   where   Selena   didn't   pause,   and,   um,   I   think   it   would   have   been   even   more   effective   had   she   done   that.   Um,   but   let's   see   how   she   talks   about   some   of   the   worries   and,   and   fleshes   it   out   a   little   bit   more.   You   know,   obviously   this   is   a   new   type   of   content.   It   could   be   a   lot   of   work,   but,   like,   what   are,   what   are   some   of   the   key   issues   that   you're   worried   about   when   thinking   about   moving   in   this   direction   or   designing   in   this   direction  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   I   think,   um,   the   first   thing   that   comes   to   mind   is   privacy.   So   if   you   are   chronicling   someone's   entire   life,   I   think,   you   know,   there's   a   lot   of   questions   there,   and   maybe   someone's   okay   with   it   when   they   start,   but   then   they're   40   and   they're   no   longer   okay   with   it.   So   how,   how   do   we   manage   that?   Um,   I   think   there's   another   one   around,   like,   retention.   So   if   this   is   something   that   you're   not   posting   for   years,   then   the   value   to   the   user   ...   Well,   I   mean,   there's   a   huge   peak   in   value   when   you   post   it.   Um,   there's   definitely   value   through   chronologging   it,   um,   or   chronicling   it.   But   can   we   make   sure   that   people   still   stay   engaged   and   excited   if   they're   not   posting   it   till   that   point?   Do   they   want   to   post   it   in   chapters?   Is   this   something   that   we   wanna   make   visible   sooner?   I   think   that's   definitely   something   I'd   want   to   experiment   with   pretty   early   on   to   understand.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   That   makes   sense.   Um,   yeah,   I   guess   I'm   also   curious,   so   yeah,   I   mean   obviously   privacy   will   be   important   because   you   might   not   want   to   show   everyone   your   life   story,   you   might   want   to   show   parts   of   it,   things   like   that.   Um,   yeah,   so   I,   I'm,   I'm   curious,   I   guess,   like,   uh,   as   a   last   maybe-...   f-   follow-up   question,   like,   yeah,   what,   what   metrics   would   you   look   at   here   to   see   or   evaluate   the   success   of   this   product?   So   we'll   talk   about   metrics   in   just   a   second,   um,   and,   and,   uh,   I   wanna   talk   a   little   bit   more   about   the   solution   and   the   space   we're   talking   about.   I   think   the   privacy   conversation   is   really   an   important   one,   um,   it's   relevant   to   Facebook   in   general,   Facebook   definitely   has   these   problems.   Celina   could   have   brought   in   that   a   little   bit   more   of,   like,   you   know,   Facebook's   mission   around   privacy,   or   Facebook's   perspective   around   privacy   is   always   putting   the   users   first,   therefore   we   should   really,   really   think   about   that   as   we   build   this   product.   Um,   but,   you   know,   a-   again,   the   solution   that   we've   gotten   to   isn't   super   precise   or   clear,   and   would   have   been   helpful   at   this   point,   or   maybe   a   little   bit   earlier   in   this   interview,   to   just   clarify,   like,   this   is   your   personal   movie.   We're   making   a   personal   movie   product   for   Facebook.   Even   adding   that   tagline   and   repeating   it   a   couple   of   times   can   be   really   effective   to   give   clarity   around   what   the   solution   actually   is.   Because   Celina   had   so   much   great   thought   up   until   this   point,   um,   and   we   really   wanna   crystallize   that   around   something   that's   really   clear   and   easy.   So   one   tip   to   kind   of   demonstrate   this   product   vision   at   this   point   in   the   interview   is   really   just   bring   in   that   tagline,   or   bring   in   this   little   b-   uh,   blurb   or   sort   of   snippet   of   what   the   actual   product   that   we're   designing   is.   And   then   it   doesn't   matter   so   much   as   what   the   exacted   details   of   it   are,   as   long   as   we   get   the   basics   down,   you   know?   We're   gonna   compile   all   these   photos   and   video   content   to   make   a   personal   movie   for   everyone,   a   living   movie   for   everyone,   um,   and   that   sort   of   has   the   gravitas   and   clarity   of   it   that   would   help   with   answering   some   of   these   questions,   and   we   tie   it   back   to   the   mission   again.   But   anyways,   um,   we'll   talk   about   now   about   metrics,   which   is   always   a   really   important   part   of   this,   is   let's   say   we   launch   something   like   this,   what   would   it   actually   look   like,   and   how   would   we   actually   measure   success?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** And,   and   yeah,   feel   free   to   add   other   pieces   also,   by   the   way,   if   there   are   other   points   you   wanted   to   touch   on   that   we   didn't   get   to   as   we   start   to   wrap   up   the   interview.  
**Candidate:** Mm-hmm.   So   I   think   in   terms   of   metrics,   there   definitely   depends   on,   like,   what   stage.   If   this   is   at   launch,   I   would   be   concerned   more   tactically,   like,   is   this   working?   Are   people   able   to   use   these   features?   Versus   more   downstream,   I'd   be   interested   in   engagement   around   the   actual   posts   themselves.  
**Interviewer:** Mm-hmm.  
**Candidate:** Um,   I   think   that   does,   again,   call   into   question,   like,   when   are   people   posting?   If   we're   posting   more   in   chapters,   then   we   can   test   engagement   sooner.   Um,   I   think   retention   is   another   one.   So   I   think   my   first   metric   would   probably   be,   like,   c-   click-through   and   maybe   n-   number   of,   number   of   installments   added   on   average   per   user.   Um,   I   probably   wanna   look   at   the   monthly   number,   if   this   is   something   that   I   wouldn't   expect   people   to   do   it   necessarily   every   day,   but   probably   a   couple   of   times   a   month   if   that's   really   the   use   case   we're   going   to.   Um,   I   probably   also   want   to   look   at   the   average   length   of   an   installment.   I   think   that   has   important   implications   on   the   storage   side,   which   is   more,   more   of   an   infrastructure   thing,   but   I   think   that's   important   to   consider.   Um,   and   I   probably   also   wanna   look   at   the   average   number   of   friends   included   in   a   creation   process.   I   think   the,   a   key   hypothesis   here   is   this   isn't   solo   creating,   this   is   a   social   living   creator   experience,   so   I   would   wanna   definitely   validate   that   by   seeing   additional   people   added.   I   don't   know   what   the   sweet   spot   is   there,   but   definitely   more   than   one   person.   Um,   yeah,   and   on   the,   on   the   retention   side,   I'd   probably   want   to   look   at   the,   the   two-month   retention   for   the   feature,   so   of   the   users   who   added   something   a   month   ago,   are   they   still   adding,   um,   30   days   later   basically?  
**Interviewer:** Got   it,   got   it.   Super   helpful.   Um,   cool.   Well,   is   there   other   p-   pieces   to   this   interview   that,   that   we   didn't   get   to   touch   on,   or   pieces   you   wanted   to   add   or   clarify   or   hone   in   on   before   we   start   to   wrap   it   up?  
**Candidate:** Um,   I   guess   maybe   there's   something   around   discovery.   So   I   mentioned   maybe   we,   we   could   put   that   in,   in   Stories,   uh-  
**Interviewer:** So   before   we   talk   about   the   final   part   of   the   interview   where   Celina   sort   of   adds   some   other   thoughts,   um,   I   do   wanna   m-   mention,   uh,   about   the   metrics   discussion,   I   think   Celina   did   a   really   great   job   of   mentioning   specific   metrics,   um,   what   I   was   missing   is   a   bucket   of   metrics   that   she   was   looking   for,   and   I   think   the   bucket   that   she's   mentioning   in   this   specific   case   was   just   engagement.   She   was   mentioning   things   like   click-through   rate   or,   you   know,   uh,   monthly,   uh,   adds   to,   to   this,   uh,   piece   of   content.   Um,   but   really,   I   think   it's   ultimately   an   engagement   thing,   and   so,   um,   when   you   as   a   viewer   are   looking   through   this,   when   you   as   an   interviewer   are   going   through   this,   uh,   rather,   um,   just   always   think   about   that   user   funnel,   um,   and   think   about,   like,   okay,   where   in   the   funnel   do   we   want   to,   uh,   actually   improve   these   metrics?   And   so   in   this   case,   I   do   think   an   engagement   metric   would   be   great.   Do   people   actually   engage   with   this?   Do   they,   um,   interact   with   it?   I   would   also   maybe   think   a   little   bit   over   retention,   um,   so   beyond   just   do   they   click,   click   on   it,   do   they,   uh,   do   the   users   that   click   on   it   stay   with   it?   Especially   if   this   is   a   product   that   sort   of   requires   people   to   stay   with   it   over   a   long   period   of   time.   After   you   kind   of   mention   these   engagement   and   retention   metrics,   it's   not   so   important   what   the   actual   metrics   are,   um,   you   can   just   mention   a   few   ways   to   measure   it.   So   she   could   say,   okay,   hey,   I   wanna   focus   on   engagement,   I   would   look   at   CTR   potentially,   I   would   look   at   this   potentially   and   that   potentially,   uh,   but   ultimately   what   I'm   measuring,   um,   the   goal   of   my   metric   here,   or   why   I'm   measuring   this   metric   is   to   understand   engagement.   Um,   and   that's,   it's   always   really   effective   to   kind   of   mention   the   goal   and,   and   sort   of   these   higher   buckets   of   metrics   as   you   talk   about   them.   Uh,   but   yeah,   let's   see   how   Celina   talks   about   discovery   now.  
**Candidate:** ...   as   a   first   point,   but   I   do   want   it   to   be   differentiated,   so   do   we   do   a,   a   big   splash?   Like,   do   we   even   launch   a   movie   like   Boyhood,   um,   to   promote   this?  
**Interviewer:** Mm-hmm.  
**Candidate:** Or   how,   how   do   we   let   people   know   that   this   is   a   new,   special,   different   way   of   chronicling   your   life   and   of   creating   video   that   is   social   and   living?   Um,   I   think   there's   an   opportunity   to   make   a   really   big   splash   to,   to   actually   do   a   video,   um,   even   if   that's,   like,   a   year.   Um,   so   yeah,   I   would,   I   would   be   considering   that   roll-out   plan,   or   maybe   we   just   wanna   focus   on   a   particular   country   and   tell   the   story   of   that   country,   and   then   use   that   to   gain   momentum.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   Yeah,   I   think   it's   interesting,   like,   it   sounds   like   there's   a   couple   angles   here   also   about,   like,   you   know,   is   it   your   own   living   story,   or   is   it,   you   know,   like,   and,   and   maybe   really   tapping   into   that   desire   to   chronicle   one's   life?   Um,   but   then   also   maybe   just,   like,   this   creative   energy   too,   and,   and   sort   of,   like-  
**Candidate:** Yeah.  
**Interviewer:** ...   which   direction   it   goes   would   be   interesting.  
**Candidate:** Mm-hmm.   I   do   think   there's   two   user   segments.   I   think   there's   the   one   which   is   chronicling   your   life,   and   there's   the   other   one   which   is   more,   like...I'm   an   indie   film   producer.  
**Interviewer:** Right,   right,   right,   right.  
**Candidate:** And   I   want   to   use   this,   this   new-  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.  
**Candidate:** ...   type   of   producing.  
**Interviewer:** (laughs)   I   guess,   yeah,   like,   a   last   question   maybe   before   we   close   would   be,   like,   which   one   of   those   two   pop-   user   populations   would   you   prioritize?  
**Candidate:** I   think   the   more   general   user.   Um,   as   we   talked   about   it,   it   really   sounded   to   me   like   a   big   opportunity   that   could   impact   any   everyday   person,   and   so   I   think   the   scope   is   much   larger.   I   think   a-   that's   great   if   indie   film   producers   can   get   value   out   of   that,   that   same   feature   set,   and   m-   maybe   long   term,   we   would   want   to   put   some   more   professional,   additional   advanced   features   on   there.   But   I   think,   again,   thinking   about   the,   the   wheelhouse   of   Facebook   is,   is   really   for   the   everyday   ci-   civilian.   It's   not   necessarily   a,   an   artistic   product,   though   we   do   have   creator   content   on   there,   so   I   would   want   to   design   for,   for   the   everyday   person.  
**Interviewer:** Um,   all   right.   So,   the   interview   is   over.   Selena   did   an   excellent   job.   Um,   I   want   to   talk   a   little   bit   about   that   last   ending   piece,   and   then   we'll   just   recap   the   full   interview.   So,   um,   whenever   your   interviewer   sort   of   gives   you   an   opportunity   to   say   anything,   which   is   sort   of   what   I   did,   it's   a   huge   lob,   and   take   advantage   of   it.   Um,   this   is   an   opportunity   to   share   anything   that   you   missed   in   the   interview,   anything   that   you   wish   you   had   stated   more,   um,   to   dive   deeper   on   an   area   you're   really   excited   about   and   passionate   about,   or   honestly,   just   to,   to   create   space   to   develop   that   connection   with   your   interviewer.   Selena   did   a   great   job   of   kinda   mentioning   a   couple   pieces   that   she   thought   were   really   important.   She   even   maybe   revised   or   talked   a   little   bit   more   about   the   user   segmentation.   As   you   go   through   the   problem,   of   course   you're   gonna   come   up   with   different   nuances   to   it   and,   uh,   maybe   want   to   slightly   modify   the   way   that   you   went   about   the   problem.   So,   take   the   time   at   the   end   if   your   interviewer   gives   that   to   you,   um,   to   create   space   for   what   you   think   is   important.   Overall,   I   think   this   was   a   super   effective   interview.   This   would   definitely   be   a   strong   hire.   Um,   Selena   has   done   an   excellent   job   of   thinking   about   the   problem,   breaking   down   the   problem   really,   uh,   concretely.   I   think   the   area   that   we   could've   improved   is   in   the   solution   space   when   Selena   was   coming   up   with   solutions.   Felt   a   little   bit   like   we   maybe   didn't   have   time   or   we   weren't   able   to   come   up   with   concrete   ideas   in   that   space,   and   it   was   a   little   more   jumbled   than   the   rest   of   the   interview.   Um,   so   it   kind   of   stood   out   there.   Um,   however,   overall,   Selena   did   a   great   job   of   tying   in   the   goals,   driving   us   to   a   solution   that   was   creative,   interesting,   thoughtful,   and   having   a   really   great   structure   throughout   the   interview.   So,   um,   ultimately,   this   was   an   awesome   interview   and   Selena   totally   crushed   it.   For   those   of   you   watching,   um,   I   hope   this   was   a   helpful   reaction   or   analysis   video   to   this   interview   video.   Please,   um,   do   let   me   know   if   it   was   valuable   by,   uh,   sort   of,   uh,   letting   us   know   in   our   private   Slack   channel   or,   uh,   just   liking   this   video   at   the   bottom   of   the   lesson   that   it's   featured   in,   and,   uh,   as   always,   good   luck   with   your   upcoming   interviews.
