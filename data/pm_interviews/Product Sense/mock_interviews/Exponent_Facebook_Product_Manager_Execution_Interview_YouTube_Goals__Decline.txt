============================================================

**Interviewer:** How   would   you   set   the   goals   for   YouTube?   (instrumental music)   Hey,   everyone.   I'm   here   today   to   do   another   product   management   mock   interview   with   Selena.   We're   super   excited   to   have   you   back   on   the   show   to   do   another   interview,   Selena.   But   before   we   jump   into   it,   could   you   tell   us   a   little   bit   more   about   yourself?  
**Candidate:** Absolutely.   Nice   to   meet   you   viewers.   My   name's   Selena.   I   am   a   product   manager   at   Facebook,   and   actually   know   Steven   from   back   during   our   time   together   at   Stanford.   Um,   and   I   also   previously   did   a   mock   interview   with   Exponent   about,   uh,   Facebook   Movies,   which   is   really   popular,   as   Steven   mentioned,   so   happy   to   be   back.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   Um,   your   video   just   reached   100,000   views.   By   the   time   people   are   watching   this   one,   it   might   be,   um,   much   more   than   that.   But   we're   super   excited   to   be   having   you   back,   uh,   today,   and   at   the   request   of   a   lot   of   people,   to   talk   about   an   execution-type   question.   These   are   more   analytical,   metrics-driven   questions   that   are   asked   by   top-tier   tech   companies.   Um,   and   so   without   further   ado,   I'll   jump   into   asking   you   the   question,   and   there'll   be   a   couple   follow-on   questions   that   we'll   do   to   investigate   the   issue   further.   Um,   and   so   first   off,   we're   gonna   be   talking   about   YouTube   today,   um,   which   is   the   platform   that   we're   gonna   be   showing   this   video   on,   um,   and,   uh,   an   awesome,   like,   big   high-growth   channel   right   now,   especially   during   the   coronavirus   pandemic.   Um,   so   the   question   that   I   have   for   you,   Selena,   is   how   would   you   set   the   goals   for   YouTube?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   absolutely.   Just   give   me   one   second   to   collect   my   thoughts.  
**Interviewer:** Take   your   time.  
**Candidate:** All   right.   (clears throat)   So   I   think   the   way   that   I'd   like   to   go   about   this   is   first   we'll   talk   a   little   bit   about   YouTube,   YouTube's   mission,   uh,   and   what   their   overarching   goals   would   be,   and,   like,   a   high-level   metric   bucket   that   we   would   wanna   set   as   success.   And   then   we'll   dive   into   user   actions   that   could   best   support   that   overall   metric   so   we   can   hone   in   a   little   bit   closer   on   what   we'd   actually   like   to   track.   And   then   from   there,   I'll   propose   some   tactical   metrics,   as   well   as   a   top-line   goal   metric,   and   then   probably   some   counter-metrics   that   we   wanna   watch   out   for.   And   then   I'll   close   it   up   with   an   evaluation   of   any   trade-offs.  
**Interviewer:** Sounds   great.   Thanks   for   laying   it   out.  
**Candidate:** Awesome.   Yeah,   so   YouTube's   mission   overall,   I   would   say,   is   to,   first   of   all,   entertain   its   users.   You   know,   billions   of   people   all   over   the   world   love   to   go   to   YouTube   to   watch   videos   every   day.   Um,   but   also   to   inform.   I   think   a   lot   of   people   also   use   YouTube   with   that   use   case   to   educate   themselves   and   learn   something   new.   Um,   so   in   terms   of   an   overall   metric,   I   think   we   could   either   go   for,   you   know,   an   engagement   bucket   metric,   or   potentially   retention   or   monetization.   Um,   so   YouTube   monetizes   with   ads,   and   they   actually   also   have   a   subscription   product,   a   couple   subscription   products.   Um,   YouTube   Premium,   YouTube   TV.   So   I   think   we   could   consider   a   monetization   as   well.   But   I   really   think   that   it's   important   to   focus   first   on   engagement,   and   then   monetization   will   follow.   So   if   you   have   users   who   are   loving   your   product,   who   are   coming   back   to   your   product   and   spending   time   in   your   product,   that's   how   you're   able   to   monetize   and,   you   know,   either   insert   ad   breaks   or   upsell   people   to   the   subscription   product.   So   I   think   I   would   really   like   to   focus   on   an   overall   goal   of   monetization.   We'll,   we'll   drill,   I   mean,   sorry,   of,   uh,   engagement,   and   we'll   drill   into   that   a   little   bit   further   as   we   go   in.  
**Interviewer:** That   sounds   great.   Um,   that   makes   sense.   Before   we   jump   into   that   perspective,   I'm   curious,   Selena,   if   you'd   have   a   perspective   on   when   we   wouldn't   prioritize   it   that   way.   Like,   would   we,   um...   Is,   is   there   a   case   you   can   imagine   where   we   might   prioritize   monetization   over   engagement?  
**Candidate:** Um,   yeah.   I   think,   you   know,   it...   YouTube   is   a   mature   product,   so   we,   we   could   focus   on   monetization   at   this   stage.   I   think   you   just   wanna   be   careful   to   not   focus   only   on   monetization   and   forget   why,   uh,   you're   building   the   product   in   the   first   place,   which   is   to   entertain   people.   I   think   once   you   have   a   really   stable,   sturdy   base,   like,   definitely   you   can   add   teams   that   really   focus   on   monetizing   and   really   growing   your,   your   books.   But   I   think,   you   know,   overall   engagement   is   the   way   to   win.   And,   you   know,   there's   competitors   encroaching   in   this   space,   like,   uh,   Facebook,   uh,   videos,   for   example,   on   Facebook   Watch.   So   I   think   engagement   is   the   way   to   go   in   this   particular   case.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   Cool,   yeah,   go   ahead   with   the   engagement,   and,   and   would   love   to   drill   into   that   more.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Awesome.   So   I   think   next   is,   um,   thinking   about   user   actions   that   would   help   to   lead   to   engagement.   So   YouTube   is   all   about   watching   videos,   so   I   would   say   that's   really   the   number   one   action   that   we   wanna   drive,   is,   you   know,   how   many   videos   users   are   watching   per   day,   how   long   they're   staying   to   watch   videos.   Um,   you   could   probably   also   look   at   the   diversity   of   videos   they're   watching.   Are   people   deep-diving   into   one   particular   area,   or   are   they   really,   you   know,   exploring   the   full   variety   of   content   from   different   content   producers   as   well?   Um,   so   I   think   that's   on   the   watch   time   side.   And   then   on   the   other   engagement   activities   that   you   can   do,   I   know   you   can   like,   you   can   comment,   you   can   subscribe.   So   I   think   those   are   all   really   important   actions   that   help   fuel   this   ecosystem.   Because,   you   know,   YouTube,   it's   not   just   viewers,   there's   also   creators,   which   is   really   important   for   the   overall   amount   of   content   that's   on   the   platform.   So   I   would   wanna   make   sure   that   there   was,   um,   you   know,   engagement   in   terms   of   users,   uh,   following   them   and   commenting   and,   and   liking.   So   I   think   those   are   the   two   buckets   that   I'm   going   to   start   with   for   now.   So   we   have   watch   time,   which   is,   you   know,   number   of   videos   watched,   overall,   you   know,   length   of   session.   And   we   can   also   look   at   the   average   per   user,   as   well   as   the   overall   top-line   numbers   there.   And   then   kind   of   other   engagement   actions,   which   was   liking,   commenting,   subscribing.   I'm   trying   to   think.   Are   there   other   actions   that   I   wanna   highlight?...   in   terms   of   engagement.   You   know,   I   think   you   could   also   consider,   on   the   creator   side,   uploads   might   be   a   way   to   measure   engagement.   I   think   I   do   wanna   focus   on   the   viewer   in   this   particular   case,   so   I,   I'll   probably   focus   more   on   there.   But   I   did   wanna   highlight   that   since   this   is   a   two-sided   market,   you'd   wanna   think   about   the   creator   side   as   well.   But   I   think   the   overall,   you   know,   North   Star   is   really   about   people   watching   on   YouTube.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   So,   now   that   we   have   this   like,   large   list   of   metrics   that   we   could   look   at,   I'm   going   to   prioritize   a   couple.   So,   I'm   going   to   pick   some   tactical   metrics   that   we   would   want   to,   you   know,   it's   more   of   a   gut   check   to   make   sure   we're   on   the   right   track,   and   then   a   top-line   metric,   which   is   our   overall   North   Star.   This   is   the   one   we   wanna   be   driving   to   accomplish   our   overall   mission   of,   um,   entertaining   and   informing   people.   Um,   and   then   I'll   also   suggest   a   tracking   metric   for,   um,   things   to   watch   out   for   to   make   sure   we're   not,   you   know,   running   into   too   many   trade-offs   along   the   way.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.   Sounds   great.  
**Candidate:** So,   I'm   just   gonna   take   one   second.  
**Interviewer:** Go   for   it.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   So,   I   have   my   three   categories.   I   have   my   tracking   metrics,   I   have   my   North   Star   metric,   and   I   have   my   counter-metrics.   So,   I'll   start   first   with   tracking.   So,   this   is   really   what's   telling   me,   if   this   was   early   on   in   the   launch   of   the   product,   that   things   are   going   in   the   right   direction.   Um,   these   are   early   indicators,   leading   indicators   that   things   are   going   well.   So,   I   would   wanna   track   average   watch   time   per   user,   and   this   is   letting   me   know,   for   a   given   user   who's   watching,   how   long   are   they   watching?   I'd   also   wanna   track   the   average   number   of   videos   watched   per   session.   This   is   giving   me   a   good   understanding   of,   you   know,   the   number   of,   of   videos   that   are   being   shown,   as   well   as   potentially   some   distribution   across   creators.   Um,   and   then   the   last   one   is   a   likes,   comments,   shares,   um,   sorry,   not   shares,   um,   subscribes   per   videos   viewed.   So,   I'd   wanna   see...   That's   almost   like   a,   a   like-through   rate,   um,   a   kind   of   blended   metric,   so   I'd   want   to   do   a   weight   to   figure   out,   you   know,   what,   what   particular   weight   of   these   leads   to   users   being   more   likely   to   come   back   and   retain   a   week   from   now   and   to   engage   more   with   videos,   and   I   would   wanna   see   a   healthy   score   there.  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.   And,   um,   on   that   last   one,   do   you   have   a   hypothesis   on   what   blend   or   how   you'd   prioritize   or   weight   some   of   those,   uh,   likes,   comments   and   shares?   Or   subs,   I   think?   Yeah.  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   I   think   here   I   would   actually   be   inclined   towards   subscribers,   because   I   think   that's   what   really   powers   the   ecosystem   that   then   would   lead   creators   to   wanna   upload   more   videos.   So,   I   think   that   would   be   really   important,   but   also,   this   is   also   a   social   product,   so   I   would   wanna   make   sure   that   there's   still,   you   know,   discussion   going   on   in   the   threads   as   well.  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.  
**Candidate:** Um,   okay.   So   then,   this   brings   me   to   my   North   Star,   which   is   really   watch   time.   At   the   end   of   the   day,   that's   how,   you   know,   you're   gonna   get   your   monetization   down   the   line   and   how   you're   also   going   to   prove   that   users   are   enjoying   the   content   that's   there.   Um,   and   this   can   vary   with   length   of   video,   so   there's   different   lengths   of,   uh,   content   on   YouTube.   Like,   this   video   will   be   a   certain   length.   So,   I   think   we'd   also   wanna   pay   attention   to,   you   know,   how   watch   time   is   distributed   as   the   length   of   content   varies,   right?   Because   maybe   you'd   have   someone   watching   a,   a   one-hour   video   and   bailing   out   and   they   only   watched   one   video   versus   people   watching   a   lot   and   there's   a   lot   of   different,   um,   content   format   lengths   that   are   coming   out.   So,   I   think   that   could   help   to   inform   the   strategy   moving   forward.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   Um,   that   sounds   like   a   great   North   Star   metric.   Like,   um,   any   concerns   with   it   as   we've   come   to   this,   or   kind   of   circling   around   this   metric?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   So,   I   think   that's   a   great,   uh,   transition   to   my   counter-metrics,   and   one   of   them   would   be,   you   know,   uh,   wanting   to   make   sure   that   people   spend   time...   it's   like   time   well   spent.   Um,   I   know   that's   a   Facebook   metric,   but   basically,   we   don't   want   people   spending   so   much   time   on   YouTube   that   they   forget   to   live.   So,   I   would   wanna   make   sure   that   people   are,   you   know,   um,   healthy   and   enjoying   the   internet   in   a   positive   way.   Um,   I   think   there's   also   a   distribution   concern,   right?   If   people   are   just   really   rabbit-holing   on   one   particular   length,   you   know,   they're   not   expanding   to   the   full   ecosystem   of,   of   creators.   So,   I'd   wanna   make   sure   that,   you   know,   all   the   different   creators   had   at   least   some   share   of   that   distribution.   Um,   and   then   I,   I   guess   there's   other   counter-metrics   that   aren't   related   to   watch   time.   Do   you,   do   you   wanna   talk   more   about   these   inverse   of   watch   time   metrics,   or   am   I   shou-   am   I   good   to   cover   the   other   counter-metrics?  
**Interviewer:** Um,   you   can   cover   the   other   counter-metrics.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Yeah.   So,   the   other   two   that   I   wanted   to   watch   out   for   was   churn,   so   this   is   all   about   engagement.   Um,   and   retention's   not   quite   the   same,   but   if   I   was   noticing,   you   know,   a   drop-off   in   users   who   weren't   coming   back   to   me,   this   would   show   me   that   the   quality   of   the   videos   we   were   showing   wasn't   matching   what   they   expected,   so   I   would   be   looking   out   for   that.   And   another   one   I   would   look   out   for   is   the   amount   of   reported   videos.   So   maybe   watch   time   is   up,   is   really   high,   but   these   videos   are,   um,   low-integrity,   which   is   a   brand   risk,   so   you   wanna   make   sure   that,   you   know,   the   content   is   up   to   a   certain   standard.   Especially   there's,   you   know,   a   lot   of   kids   that   watch   YouTube,   so   I'd   wanna   make   sure   that,   you   know,   our   community,   uh,   was   a   positive   and   safe   place   for   all   of   our   users   to   be.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   That   makes   a   lot   of   sense.   Um,   any   other   comments   about   the   metrics   and,   and   sort   of   the   ones   that   you've...   the   counter-metrics   as   well   before   I   ask   a   hypothetical   question   about,   um,   the   metrics?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   I   think   you   could   maybe   also   consider   the   counter-metric   of,   of,   um,   creator   distribution.   You   know,   I   kind   of   mentioned   that   as   something   you'd   wanna   track   along   watch   time,   but   I   could   see   that   also   being   a   counter-metric   to   look   out   for   if   you   just   saw   a   really   high   concentration   on   specific   videos.   Um,   I   know   this   is   also   something   that,   uh,   YouTube   changed   the   way   that   videos   could   go   viral   to   help   ensure   kind   of   more   distribution   for,   um,   all   different   types   of   videos.   So,   you   wouldn't   want   too   much   watch   time   concentrating   on   any   one   particular   producer   or   video   type.   So,   you   might   wanna   track   that   not   just   as   a   North   Star   but   as   a   counter-metric   as   well.
**Interviewer:** Totally.   Um,   okay.   Awesome.   Well,   thanks   for   the   thoughtful   discussion   around   watch   time.   I   wanna   transition   this   interview   into   a   different   sort   of   question   where   we're   going   to   imagine   that   that   key   North   Star   metric   that   you   picked   of   watch   time,   um,   is   unfortunately   suffering   a   three   to   four   percent   decline   over   the   past   couple   of   weeks.   Um,   and   so   ...   um,   or,   you   know,   weeks   to   months   maybe,   uh,   let's   approximate.   But,   um,   the   time   region   isn't   so   important   as   in   so   far   as   ...   what   I   want   you   to   do   is   to   imagine   that   you're   a   PM   at   this   team,   um,   and   you   know,   you've   done   this   thoughtful   consideration   around   watch   time.   Um,   but   how   would   you   investigate   what's   going   on   here   or   what's   causing   this   decline   in   that   North   Star   metric?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   absolutely.   So   I   think   the   most   important   thing   whenever   this   happens   in   an   interview   situation   or   in   real   life   on   the   job   as   a   product   manager,   you   wanna   start   by   asking   questions.   You   never   wanna   immediately   just   run   off   and   start   diving   into   the   data   by   yourself.   Like,   make   sure   that   you're   asking   some   key   questions   about   this   new   trend.   So,   I   think   the   first   thing   I'd   wanna   ask   is,   how   long   has   this   been   happening?   Did   this   happen   yesterday?   Has   this   been   going   on   for   a   week,   maybe   a   month?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   Let's   say   that   it's   been   happening   for   weeks   to   a   month.   So   maybe   like   four   weeks,   um,   to   a   month   or   two   ago,   like   we've   seen   this   decline.   So   um,   within   the   range   of   like   two   to   three   months   or   one   to   three   months   or   so.  
**Candidate:** Got   it.   So   sounds   like   it's   been   going   on   for   a   while.   Does   that   mean   it's   been   a   gradual   change   or   was   it   acute   like   three   months   ago   and   we're,   we're   just   now   getting   around   to   dealing   with   it?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   We're   seeing   the   gradual   decline   to   the   state   where   it   is   today   over   the   past   few   months.  
**Candidate:** Got   it.   Okay.   So   I   think   my   next   question   would   be,   are   we   seeing   this   decline   across   the   board   in   terms   of   geography   or   is   there   a   par-   particular   geography   where   we're   noticing   a   decline?  
**Interviewer:** We're   seeing   the   decline   actually   mostly   in   the   domestic   markets,   so   United   States.   Um,   we're   not   seeing   the   decline   as   much   in   emerging   markets   or   foreign   markets.  
**Candidate:** Got   it.   That's   good   to   know.   Okay,   let   me   think   a   little   bit.   You   know,   normally   I   would   ask,   is   it   just   this   product   or   a   broader   product?   But   since   it's   YouTube,   that's   kind   of   the,   the   whole   thing.   I   guess   I   could   ask-  
**Interviewer:** Mm-hmm.  
**Candidate:** ...   um,   there   is   YouTube   TV   and   YouTube   Premium.   Is   this   focused   on   watch   time   of   a   particular   segment?  
**Interviewer:** Um,   that's   a   great   question.   It's   not   focused   on   a   particular   segment.   So   we're   seeing   this   decline   kind   of   across   the   board   on   YouTube   over   the   past   couple   of   months.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   All   right.   This   is   going   to   be   my   last   question   before   I'll   put   into   buckets   my   kind   of   issue   triage   identification-  
**Interviewer:** Sure.  
**Candidate:** ...   which   is,   is   there   a   particular   device   type   that   this   is   focused   on?  
**Interviewer:** Great   question.   Um,   there   isn't   a   device   type   associated   with   this   decline.   So   devices   seem   to   be   uniform   across   iPhone,   Android,   um,   as   well   as   the   different   device   types   within   those   categories.   So   like,   um,   the   different   iPhones   or   the   different,   uh,   you   know,   Samsung   or,   um,   like,   uh,   Pixel   phones.  
**Candidate:** Got   it.   Okay.   So   at   this   point   I'm   gonna   pause   my   general   questions   and   then   I'll   focus   in   three   different   buckets   of   where   I   think   the   issue   could   be   arising.   And   I   like   to   think   about   this   as   internal   to   my   team.   Um,   so   I   should   probably   ask   you   what   team   I'm   on.   Um,   and   internal   to   the   company   and   then   external   are   the   three   general   buckets   I   look   into.   So   I,   I   know   I'm   at   YouTube.   Is   there   any   particular   team   that   I'm   on?  
**Interviewer:** Um,   let's   say   that   you're   on   the,   um,   general   YouTube   team.   You're   not   on   Premium   or   YouTube   TV.   You're   on   the   YouTube   product   that   people   generally   see   when   they   come   to   youtube.com   as   a   non-paying   user.  
**Candidate:** Got   it.   Okay.   So   given   what   I'm   hearing   that   this   happened   gradually   from   weeks   to   months,   focused   in   the   US   and   it's   happening   across   the   board,   this   would   lead   me   to   think   it   was   either   due   to   something   that   happened   externally,   potentially   with   a   competitor,   or   that's   something   that   happened   internally   that   has   happened   over   time,   um,   that's   either   due   to   an   experiment   or   a   deprioritization.   But   since   it's   gradual,   this   is   telling   me   that   it's   a   user   behavior   shift   normally   more   than   it   would   be,   um,   an   infrastructure   issue   or   a   system   that   went   down,   um,   which   would   typically   demonstrate   a   more,   um,   acute   sudden   decline.   So,   uh,   I'll   run   through   a   couple   questions.   I   think   first   I'll   ask   the,   the   burning   question,   which   is,   you   know,   uh,   did   our   competitors   launch   something   when,   within   that   three-month   period   that's   drawing,   um,   share   away   from   our   products?   'Cause   that's   kind   of   what   I'm   feeling   is   maybe   most   at   play.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   So,   um,   definitely   we've   seen   a   lot   of   competitive   products   in   this   space   in   the   past   couple   of   months.   Um,   and   so   there   is   tough   competition   and   we   do   know   that   from   just   like   a   marketing   or   partnerships   perspective.   But   it's   a   little   unclear   to   us   right   now   if   that's   the   reason   that   we're   experiencing   the   decline,   but   that   definitely   could   be   something   we   want   to   investigate   further.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Got   it.   Um,   all   right.   Let   me   think.   Um,   maybe   I'm   also   thinking   externally.   I   know   we   work   with,   uh,   partners   and   third   parties.   So   is   there   anything   that   happened   potentially   with   a   partner   or   someone   that   we   work   with   that   would   have   gradually   caused   this   decline?   Maybe   they   were   migrating   off   of   ...   um,   like   I   know   we   offer   YouTube   on   TVs,   maybe   some   older   TVs   no   longer   support   our   YouTube   app   or,   or   something   like   that   that   could   be   causing   the   issue.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   that's   a   great   question.   And   you   know,   a   lot   of,   for   example,   um,   Android   devices   might   partner   with   certain   OEMs   to   make   sure   certain   apps   appear   there.   And   there   could   be   a   case   where   the   YouTube   app   did   not   appear   on   a   device   partner.   Uh,   but   in   this   case,   um,   we're   not   seeing   any   changes   in   partnerships.   In   fact,   the   partnership   season,   let's   just   say,   is   in   two   months.   So   the   renewals   of   all   those   contracts   would   have   happened   then   and   it   wouldn't   have   happened   within   the   past   few   months.  
**Candidate:** Got   it.Um,   let's   see.   So,   I   guess   this   is   my   last   external   question   before   I   go   into   internal   to   the   company   problems.   Was   there   any   bad   press   that   happened   about   our   company,   um,   maybe   a   couple   of   months   ago   that   would   cause   users   to   slowly   but   surely   abandon?  
**Interviewer:** (laughs)   Um,   it's   a   great   question   again.   I   mean,   uh,   Sundar   Pichai   himself   has   been   testifying   in   front   of   the   US   government.   Um,   so   there   could   be   something   there,   but   for   now,   ?????   purposes,   we're   not   seeing   something   so   damaging   or   so   shocking   that   would   have   caused   a   huge   change   in   the   metrics.  
**Candidate:** Got   it.   Okay.   So,   now   I'll   ask   some   questions   that   probably   are   arising   from,   uh,   internal   to   the   company   issues,   um,   but   I'm   still   holding   onto   that   it   could   have   been   something   with   the   competition,   uh,   in   the   back.  
**Interviewer:** Cool.  
**Candidate:** So,   my   second-leading   theory,   uh,   second   from,   uh,   competition,   would   actually   be   cannibalization.   So,   did   we   launch   something   new   that's   separate   from   watch   time,   um,   that   would   maybe   be   drawing   users   slowly   away,   um,   or   maybe   something   we're   experimenting   with   that's   being   rolled   out   gradually   that   could   be   impeding   watch   time?  
**Interviewer:** Yes.   So,   we've   actually   launched,   um,   a   feature   on   YouTube   where   you   can   see...   It's   kinda   sort   of   like   Instagram   Reels   or   TikTok,   um,   where   we've   created   a   lot   of,   like,   short   clips   of   videos   that   users   can   browse   through   really   quickly.  
**Candidate:** YouTube   Shorts?   Yes,   very   clever.  
**Interviewer:** (laughs)  
**Candidate:** Um,   yeah.   Well,   I   would   say   that   that   would   be   likely,   since   it's   shorter   length   content,   to   lead   to   a   decrease   in   watch   time.   3%   to   4%   seems   pretty   consistent,   where   I   wouldn't   expect   it   to   be   an   enormous   sea   change,   but   as   users   are   adopting   this   product   more   and   more,   um,   if   that   length   of   videos   is   shorter   than   the   typical   YouTube   video   length,   then   you   would   see   a   corresponding   drop   in   watch   time.   Um-  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.  
**Candidate:** So-  
**Interviewer:** Go   ahead.  
**Candidate:** ...   like,   that's   not   necessarily   a   bad   thing.   You   know,   um,   given   all   of   the,   uh,   engagement,   especially   among   younger   audiences   with   TikTok,   this   could   be   a   strategic   choice.   Um,   and   it   is   a   strategic   choice   to,   to   launch   this   product,   so   I   wouldn't   say   that   it's   necessarily   a   cause   for   alarm   in   the   near   term,   but   we   should   definitely   be   thinking   about,   you   know,   how   much   watch   time   are   we   willing   to   give   up,   um,   to   support   this   new   product   launch.   And,   you   know,   maybe,   maybe   watch   time   isn't   the   right   North   Star.   Maybe   it's,   you   know,   how   much   e-   enjoyment   users   are   getting   out   of   the   videos.   And   since   there's   a   general   trend   towards   shorter   videos,   maybe,   you   know,   a   total   max   watch   time   isn't   necessarily   the   best   demonstrator   of   people   enjoying   this   new   product.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   Um,   and   yeah,   like,   you   know,   in   this   particular   case   that   we're   talking   about   today,   um,   we   can   imagine   that   YouTube   Shorts   was   just   launched.   Um,   and   so   in   that   case,   the   algorithm   wasn't   quite   right,   maybe,   let's   say,   to   ensure   long-term   engagement   or   longer   term   watch   time.   Um,   and   so   that   might   have   cannibalized   some   of   the   YouTube   traffic   that   we   normally   expect   with   users   watching   short-form   content   that   is   not   as   effective   at   finding   the   algorithm   to   get   users   to   continue   to   watch   the   experience.   Um,   which   could   definitely   happen   when   a   company   launches   a   new   product,   but   hopefully   in   the   future   cases,   YouTube   wouldn't   see   that   decline,   um,   as   much.  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   absolutely.   I   think   since   algorithms   learn   from   user   behavior,   it's   almost   expected   in   the   near   term   if   you're   moving   away   from   a   longer   content   form   to   a   shorter   content   form   that   it's   not   gonna   immediately   get   it   right.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   Um,   so   congrats   on   giving   the   right   answer.   I   know   it's   stressful,   and   I   think   you   did   a   great   job   kind   of   discussing   a   lot   of   the   different   criteria.   Um,   I'm   curious   also   for   you,   if   you   were   going   to   just   dig   any   further,   is   there   anything   else   you   would   have   explored,   um,   had   you   had   the   opportunity   to,   to   explore   some   of   the   other   avenues   or   answers?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   So,   um,   I   think   a   similar   side   of   the   coin,   I   would   ask,   you   know,   are   we   deprioritizing   our   regular   product   in   favor   of   another   one?   Which   is   kind   of   the   exact   same   question,   but   focusing   instead   on,   on   the   relative   prioritization   of   the   two   products,   which   I   think   is   absolutely   true.   Um,   I,   sometimes   I   look   at   internal   to   the   team,   which   I   think   with   a   product   like   YouTube,   maybe   is   a   little   less   valid,   but   sometimes   you   can   think,   okay,   did   my   particular   team   launch   an   experiment   that's   impacting   another   team   or   vice   versa.   Um,   I   think   here   it's   easier   to   think   about   it   as   a   total   platform   effect   because   of,   um,   the   way   YouTube   is   as   a   product.   That's   always   an   area   I   like   to   explore   as   well.  
**Interviewer:** Totally.   Um,   well,   Selena,   you   can   take   off   the   interviewee   hat.   You   did   an   awesome   job.   I   wanna   debrief   (laughs) .   Yeah,   I   wanna   debrief,   um,   like,   how   this   was   for   you.   And,   um,   I   wrote   down   some   thoughts   on   what   I   thought   you   did   so   awesome   with   this   interview   and   I   thought   it   was   a   really   rich,   uh,   conversation   that's   really   educative   also,   so   I'm   really   grateful   you   were   able   to   do   this.   But   before   I   jump   into   my   thoughts,   did   you   have   any   self-reflection   or,   um,   self-feedback   on   how   that   went   for   you?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   I   think   overall   it   went   really   well.   I   mean,   full   disclosure,   I   did   intern   at   YouTube,   uh,   about   a   year   and   a   half   ago   now.   It   feels   like   forever.   Um,   so   I   did   have   a   little   bit   of   familiarity   wi-   with   the   company.   Um,   and   yeah,   I   think   the,   the   one   area   that   I   felt   like   I   could   have   done   a   little   bit   better   was   defending   why   not   to   go   for   monetization.   Um,   you   know,   I   think   it,   it's   always   a   little   bit   of   a   snake   chasing   its   own   tail   between,   uh,   engagement   and   monetization,   but   you   can't   run   a   company   without   having   money   at   the   end   of   the   day.   So,   I   think   that's   something   that's   important   to   understand   when   is   the   right   time   to   focus   on   that   and   I   think   that's   something   a   lot   of   companies   struggle   with.   Um,   but   otherwise,   I   thought   that,   that   part   was   good.   I   think   maybe   you   were   looking   for   a   different   trade-off   that   I   didn't   mention   during   the,   the   metric   identification,   so   I   guess   I'll,   I'll   listen   to   you   on   that   front.   Um,   and   then,   uh,   in   the   second   half   around   the   issue   identification,   I   think   there's   two   kind   of   flavors   for   this.   Sometimes   interviewers   are   looking   for   you   to   identify,   um,   the   case,   and   sometimes   they   just   wanna   hear   how   you   would   talk   through   that.   So,   I-   I've   experienced   both   in   my,   my   interviewing   experience,   and   I   think,   you   know,   either   way,   you   wanna   just   be   reasoned   with   your   thinking.   And   if   you   don't   always   get   to   the   right   answer,   even   if   that's   what   they   were   looking   for   and   you   talk   through   it   in   a   structured   way,   I   think   you   can   still   do   well.
**Interviewer:** Totally,   that's   awesome   advice.   Um,   yeah,   let   me   run   through...   I   mean,   I   agree   with   what   you   said.   I,   I...   Some   things   that   I   thought   you   did   really,   really   effectively,   Selena,   were   one,   y-   you   did   such   a   great   job   checking   in   with   me.   I   felt   like   I   was   always   on   the   same   page   with   you   throughout   that   interview.   Um,   and,   you   know,   y-   you   even   did   stuff   where   you   would   say,   like,   you   know,   "I'm   gonna   move   on   to   this   section,"   and   you   really   communicated   with   me   frequently   throughout   the   interview.   Especially   with   execution   questions,   it   gets   really   easy   to   kind   of   slip   into   this   pattern   where   you're   gonna   say,   "Hey,   like,   is   it   this,   is   it   that,   is   it   this?"   And   then,   um,   I,   as   an   interviewer,   don't   really   have   a   sense   of   what   you're   thinking   or   how   you're   thinking   about   that   problem.   And   so   that's   not   an   effective   tool,   you   know,   for   the   interviewer   to   assess   your   capabilities.   But,   um,   one   line   in   particular   that   stood   out   to   me   was,   you   know,   you   said,   "I'm   gonna   keep   competition   in   the   back   of   my   head   or   over   here.   Um,   and   you   know,   I'm   gonna   move   on   to   this   section."   And   I   thought   that   was   really   effective   because   you,   you   sort   of   acknowledged   to   the   interviewer,   "You   know,   I   haven't   fully   figured   that   out,   um,   and   I   know   it's   still   an   open   issue,   but   I'm   gonna   investigate   these   other   things."   And   I   thought   that   communication   style   was   really,   really   valuable.   Um,   I   also   thought   you   did   a   great   job   of   breaking   down   the   problem.   So   you'd   often   enumerate   or,   um,   split   up   the   problem   space   into   different   components.   For   example,   internal,   external   to   my   company.   Internal...   Or   sorry,   internal   to   the   team,   internal   to   the   company,   or   external.   That   was   a   really   awesome   way   to   break   down   the   problem   and   to   know   where   your   head   was   throughout   each   of   those   steps,   so   I   thought   that   was   really   effective   as   well.   And   you   did   that   a   couple   times.   Um,   I   think,   you   know,   I,   I   may   have   jumped,   uh,   ahead   of   you   on   this   one,   but   mentioning   counter   metrics   beforehand   or,   you   know,   making   sure   you   slip   those   in   is   really   important.   Um,   I   actually   didn't   have   a   specific,   uh,   counter   metric   that   I   was   looking   for,   so   it's   funny   that   you   thought   that   maybe   I   was   just   putting   on   my   tough   interviewer   face   or   something.   But,   um,   it   was   more,   more...   Honestly,   like,   uh,   the   counter   metric   discussion   that   I   think   you   did   was   a   really   thoughtful   one.   And,   um,   if   I   had   more   time,   I   would've   asked   you   more   about,   you   know,   like,   time   well   spent,   what   does   that   look   like   in   that   experience.   Um,   I   do   agree,   the   monetization   angle,   we   could've   had   maybe   a   richer   conversation   around   that.   Um,   but   I   didn't   think   that   that   was   so,   um,   important   to   the   essential   interview   question   I   was   asking.   It   was   kind   of   a   side   tangent   that   I   took   you   along.   Um,   so   honestly,   overall,   I,   I...   And   the   last   thing   that   I   wanted   to   mention   is   that   you   really   did   a   good   job   of   thinking   about   the   goals   of   the   company   first.   These   questions   often   seem   tricky,   but   they,   um,   really   make   a   lot   of   sense   when   you   think   about   the   goals.   And   so   I   love   that   you   thought   about   the   goals   first   and   then   kind   of   boiled   it   down.   So,   um,   I   don't   have   too   much   constructive   feedback.   I   thought   this   was,   like,   a   really   awesome   answer.   It   was   a   really   fun   conversation   also.   Um,   and   then,   yeah,   maybe,   maybe   one   last   point   that   I   would   say   is   just   that   the   execution   part   at   the   end,   um,   you   know,   being   specific   about   how   you'd   identify   those   issues.   So   you   knew   you   asked   if   they're   competitors,   um,   but   there   might   be   more   specific   ways   to   identify   competitive,   com-   competitive,   uh,   companies   in   this   space.   Um,   so   perhaps   you   could've   asked   about,   like,   um,   you   know,   are   there   other   analogous   products   within   Google's   ecosystem   or   partner   network   that   have   seen   a   decline?   Or   maybe,   are   users   of   YouTube's   API,   um,   seeing   a   decline   or,   you   know,   embedded   videos   on   YouTube   seeing   a   decline?   That   might   start   to   hint   at   if   it's   a   competitive   issue   or   not.   So,   um,   that   was   just   one,   uh,   constructive   piece   of   feedback.   But   overall,   a   really   awesome   interview.   Um,   do   you   have   any   thoughts,   reactions,   comments,   or,   or   last   tips   for   the   viewers?  
**Candidate:** No,   I   think   that   all   sounds   great,   and   I   think   that's   a   really   awesome   suggestion   to,   you   know,   think   about   other,   other   ways   to   plug   into   is   this   an   internal   or   external   issue   outside   of   the,   the   core   product.   So   I   think   APIs,   um,   was   a   great   suggestion   if   that's   the   type   of   product   you're   focusing   around   to,   um,   get   at   that   same   question   from   a   different   angle.
