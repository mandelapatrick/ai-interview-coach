**Interviewer:** ...   how   you   would   measure   success   for   preventing   misinformation   at   Facebook.   (instrumental music)   Hey,   everyone.   My   name's   Kevin   Wei.   I   am   a   product   manager   on   IBM's   data   integration   team,   and   today,   we're   gonna   be   doing   a   mock   PM   interview   with   Steven.   And   before   we   get   started,   Steven,   do   you   mind   letting   the   audience   know   who   you   are?  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   happy   to.   Uh,   my   name's   Steven   Jenkins.   I'm   an   incoming   PM   technical   at   Amazon   on   their   supply   chain   optimization   technology   team.  
**Interviewer:** Thanks   for   coming   on   and   paying   it   forward.   So   y-   I   know   that   you   were   coming   from   the   course,   you   got   a   lot   of   value   from   the   course,   and   you   also   got   a   really,   really   cool   offer   from   Google.   Um,   so   thanks   for   coming   on   today's   show.   So   for   today's   mock   interview,   I'd   like   to   ask   you   how   you   would   measure   success   for   preventing   misinformation   at   Facebook?  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Uh,   sounds   like   a   fun   question   to   tackle.   Um,   can   we   start   by   just   me   asking   you   a   couple   questions,   um,   in   terms   of   objectives,   um,   you   know,   maybe   users   that   we   want   to,   to   build   a   product   for?  
**Interviewer:** Of   course.  
**Candidate:** Uh,   and,   and,   and   the   metrics   that   we   wanna,   we   wanna   track.   So,   um,   yeah.   First   question   I   have   for   you,   Kevin,   is,   um,   yeah,   do   we   have   any   specific   business   objectives   that   we   want   to,   um,   optimize   for   and,   and   track?   Um,   or   would   you   like   me   to   suggest   a   couple   that   come   to   mind?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   so   Facebook's   been   in   the   news,   horrible   PR,   so   I   would   like   for   you   to   choose   what,   which   metrics   you   think   are   good.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Um,   yeah,   let   me   just   take,   uh,   one   second   to   gather   a   couple   thoughts,   um,   if   that's   all   right   with   you.  
**Interviewer:** Sounds   good.   Yup.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Uh,   so   three   ideas   come   to   mind   in   terms   of,   you   know,   well,   Facebook,   um,   obviously   Facebook's   a   publicly   traded   company,   fiduciary   responsibility   to   their   shareholders   to   deliver   value.   Um,   so   always   gonna   be   considering,   you   know,   revenue,   bottom   line.   Um,   but   since   this   is   more   of   a,   of,   of   a,   of   a   nuanced,   you   know,   objective,   uh,   or   a   nuanced   question,   it   being,   you   know,   preventing   misinformation.   Um,   the   second   is,   you   know,   corporate   social   responsibility   and,   and   the   company's   brand.   Um,   you   know,   Facebook   is,   uh,   heavily,   heavily   dependent   on   users   coming   back   on   a   daily,   uh,   basis.   And   if,   you   know,   if,   if   they   get   part   of   a,   you   know,   Delete   Facebook   movement,   you   know,   or   Delete   Uber   movement,   um,   you   know,   that,   that   could   have   a,   a,   a   very,   you   know,   negative   impact   on   their   brand   and   therefore   their   revenue.   And   then   the   third,   um,   that   comes   to   mind   is,   you   know,   en-   is,   is   engagement.   So,   um,   how   do   we   increase   the   engagement?   How   do   we   get   more   eyeballs   into,   um,   into,   into   Facebook's   core,   um,   product   offering?   I   should   also   ask,   is   there   a   specific   product   at   Facebook   that   we   want   to   be   considering?   Um,   do   we   wanna   talk   about   WhatsApp?   Do   you   wanna   talk   about,   you   know,   Facebook   as   we   know   Facebook   or   Instagram?   Oculus?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   just   the   core   Facebook   products,   so   facebook.com.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Sounds   good.   .com.   All   right.   Um,   so   how   would   I   measure   success   for   preventing   misinformation   on   Facebook?   Um,   so   we've   hit   on,   like,   really   the,   the   high   level   things.   I   wanna   dive   a   little   bit   deeper.   Maybe   I'll   just   think   out   loud,   um,   because   w-   the   idea   is   we   want   to,   um,   you   know,   we,   we   really   want   to,   you   know,   w-   how   do   we   actually   quantify   our   success   rate   for,   you   know,   information?   Um,   and   misinformation   is,   is   very,   uh,   subjective.   It's,   it's   hard   to   do.   You   know,   it's   like   Twitter.   How   d-   how   does   Twitter   decide   what   is   truth   and   what   is   not   truth?   Um,   Facebook   has   the   same   problem.   Um,   so   without   getting   into   the   product   yet,   'cause   I   wanna   get   more   into   like   use,   use   cases   and   pain   points,   um,   maybe   I'll   just   talk   about,   um,   you   know,   what,   what   users   might   want   to,   to,   to   have,   like,   options   that   they   might   want   to   have   in   order   to,   to   help   to,   to,   to,   to   fix   this   problem,   um,   and   to   create   alignment   between   the   users   and,   and,   and   Facebook.   So,   um,   do   we   want   to,   like,   consider   a,   a   specific   demographic?   Do   you   have   any,   anyone   in   mind?   You   know,   age   groups?   Geographies?   Um,   languages?   Things   like   that?  
**Interviewer:** It's   totally   up   to   you   if   you   wanna   hone   in   on   one.   I   think   that   we're   concerned   about   users   who   are   sharing   and   spreading,   uh,   misinformation.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   So   sharing   plus   spreading.  
**Interviewer:** And   to   give   you   some   context,   you   can   think   about   users   through   different   types.   So   perhaps   there   are   some   users   who   are   doing   it   accidentally,   some   who   are   doing   it   opportunistically,   and   some   others   who   are   doing   it   intentionally.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Um,   that   sounds   good.   Um,   and   just   to   clarify,   are   we   more   concerned   for   the,   the   sake   of   this   discussion   about   the   people   who   are   sharing   and   spreading   in-   misinformation   than   we   are   the   people   who   are   consuming   it?  
**Interviewer:** Which   one   do   you   think   is   more   important?  
**Candidate:** Um,   well,   you   wanna   cut   it   off   at   the,   at   the   bud,   right?   So,   um,   if   we   c-   if   we   focus   on,   um,   the   people   who   are,   you   know,   really   the   ones   who   are,   are   creating   it,   um,   then,   then   I   think   we'll   have   the   most   success.   Um,   it   might   be   a   little   bit   more   difficult,   because   there's   just   so   much   more   nuance,   um,   in,   in   deciding   what   is   truth,   what   is   not   truth,   um,   versus   like,   someone   who's   just   s-   simply   sharing   information,   because   that   piece   of   information   could   come   from   someone   th-   that   they   know   and   therefore   trust.
**Interviewer:** Yep,   that,   that   makes   sense.   Let's   say   that,   you   know,   there's,   there's   this   viral   loop   going   on.   Content   that   comes   on   is   never   static.   As   soon   as   it   comes   on,   people   are   sharing   it   and   interacting   with   it,   so   we   do   want   to   cut   it   at   the   bud,   like   you   said.   So   let's   go   down   here.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   great.   And,   um,   so   we're,   we're   gonna,   we   wa-   we're   gonna   wanna   talk   about   metrics   is,   do,   do   you   wanna   talk   about   metrics   through   the   context   of   actually   suggesting   a,   a   product   enhancement   or   are   you   more   interested   in,   um,   just   like   specific   metrics   that   we   can   track?   'Cause   I   do   have   some   ideas   on   how   we   could   like   create   improvements   or,   or   changes   to   the   product   that   we   could   then   use   in   order   to   potentially,   um,   track   those   metrics   and   know   whether   or   not   we're   meeting   this,   you   know,   core   objective   of   decreasing   the   spread   of   misinformation.   What   do   you   think?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   if   you   have   some   i-   ideas   we   can   go   down   that   route   and   then   we   can   bookmark   the   metrics   discussion,   but   let's   not   forget   the   metrics.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Okay,   cool.   Um,   so   okay,   so   Facebook   metrics,   the,   the   key   ones,   um,   for   spreading   informa-   misinformation,   um,   that   come   to   mind   are,   um,   you   know,   so   Facebook   has   a,   a   bunch   of   different,   um,   s-   sort   of   ways   in   which   to   know   whether   or   not   something   is,   is   being   in-   interacted   with   on,   on,   in   a,   in,   in   a   big   way.   Um,   so   we   could   be   tracking   likes,   um,   but   obviously   they   also   have,   you   know,   dislikes,   they   have   happy,   um,   you   know,   they   have   the,   the   different   engagement   levels.   Um,   something   could   be   shared   so   we   might   wanna   ch-   track   shares.   Um,   so   likes,   uh,   dislikes,   uh,   angry,   things   like   that,   shares,   um,   you   know,   when   it   comes   to   like   spreading   misinformation,   I   know   a   lot   of   misinformation   is   spread   throughout,   um,   like   Facebook   groups,   right?   Um,   so   we   might   wanna   track   like   how   likely   is   someone   to,   you   know,   what,   what   ha-   what   happens,   um,   with,   you   know,   a,   a   post,   for   example,   uh,   like   what,   what   are   the,   the   differences   when   it's   just   like   me   posting   up   to   everyone   on   my   feed   versus   like   me   posting   out   to   someone   who   is,   you   know,   in   a,   in   a   group?   So   like   QAnon   for   example.   Um,   what,   what   is   the   impact   of   that?   Um,   so   I'd   break   out   sharing   into   two   different   segments.   The   first   is   to   friends   and   to   family,   um,   but   the   second   one   is   into   like   these   groups.   Um,   and,   um,   hmm-  
**Interviewer:** And   certainly   there's   also   people   who-  
**Candidate:** ...   so   likes-  
**Interviewer:** ...   who   post   s,   uh,   pub-   publicly,   right?   And   then   people   interact   with   it   and   those   go   viral   on   the   newsfeed.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   so   let's   go   with   that   one,   um,   as   the   third   one.   So,   um,   so   groups,   public,   um,   and   friends.   Uh,   and,   and   of   the   three,   yeah,   between   groups   and   public   I'd   say,   um,   that's   where   the   most   virality   comes   from.   Um,   but,   but   yeah,   the,   I,   I,   I'd   be   looking   for,   for   things   to   sort   of   originate   in   this   echo   chamber,   um,   and   then   tracking   whether   or   not,   you   know,   if   they   are,   if   it   is   a   public   piece   of   information,   how,   how   widely   shared   it,   it,   it's   being.   Um,   I   think   that   once   something   gets   wi-   widely   shared   if,   if   there   are   a   lot   of   people   who   are   liking   it   and   a   lot   of   people   who   are   disliking   it,   that   will   be   a,   a   proxy   for,   um,   whether   or   not   this   is   a   very   divisive   topic.   Um,   and   a   lot   of   these   divisive   topics,   of   course   are,   um,   uh,   you   know,   I,   I   imagine   that   there's   a   correlation   between   something   that's   very   divisive   and   something   that's   potentially   misinformation.   Um,   I   know   that   Facebook   also   has,   uh,   experimented   with,   you   know,   flagging,   the   same   way   Twitter   has.   Um,   you   know,   is   this,   you   know,   information,   uh,   trustworthy,   for   example.   Um,   so   we,   we'd   be   wanting   to,   to,   to,   uh,   measure   whether,   you   know,   you   know,   how,   how,   how   widely   flagged   is   something   and   also,   you   know,   misinformation   I   know   spreads   more   fa-   you   know,   incorrect   information   spreads   faster   than   correct   information.   Um,   you   know,   this,   for   the   same   reason   that,   you   know,   it's   hard   to   take   your,   your   eyeballs   off   of   a   car   crash.   Um,   so   I'd   be   wanting   to,   to,   to   look   at   the   velocity   of   sharing,   um,   that's   taking   place   on   a   specific   post.   Um,   but   of,   of   course,   it,   it,   it'd   be   very   difficult   to   actually   start   to   quantify   these,   maybe   build   AI   around   preventing   this.   Um,   I   know   that   that's   not   the   objective   of,   of   what   we're   talking   about   here,   but,   um,   it   could   be   a   potential   benefit   having,   you   know,   really   strong   metrics   in   place.   Um,   so   yeah,   so   to,   to,   to   sort   of   l-   start   to   build   out   a   foundation   for,   um,   for,   for   the   second   half   of   this   discussion   I   would   say,   the   things   that   I'm   looking   at,   um,   very   closely   metrics   wise   on   a   specific   post,   um,   is,   you   know,   is   it   public,   one?   Um,   how   many,   what's   the   likes   to   dislikes   ratio?   Um,   what   is   the   total   engagement   for   the   post?   Um,   how   many   flags,   um,   has   this   been   given?   Um,   and,   um,   what's   the,   uh,   velocity   of   spread   for   this   particular   piece?   Um-...   and   if   I   were   to   start   to   prioritize   them,   I   think   the   flag   is,   is   one   of   the   most,   uh,   powerful   one,   because   we're   getting   the   user   feedback   saying,   "Hey,   this   might   be   misinformation."   Um,   the   other   ones,   it's-   it's   much   harder   to-   to-   to,   um,   to   do,   but   it's-   it's   just   information   that   we'll   want   to   track,   so   that   later   on,   we   can   maybe   go-   go-   go   back   and   say,   "This   is   indeed   misinformation,"   and-   and   here   are   the,   um,   h-   sort   of   heuristics   or   the,   um,   these   are   the   patterns   that   we   see   in   terms   of-  
**Interviewer:** So...  
**Candidate:** ...   velocity.   Likes   to   dis-   dislikes   ratio,   volume   of   engagement,   these   types   of   things.  
**Interviewer:** Right,   so   your   North   Star   sounds   like   the   number   of   flags,   and   you   have   all   these,   uh,   supplementary   metrics   that   are   going   to   help.   I'm-   I'm   kind   of   curious   if   you   think   that,   uh,   like,   are-   are   these   metrics   strictly   correlated   to   misinformation,   or   could   they   also   pop   up   for   other   types   of   viral   content?  
**Candidate:** They   absolutely   could,   which   is-   which   is   why   I'm   saying   it-   it-   it's   information   that   we'll   want   to-   to   track,   um,   but   we'll   wanna   bring   in   some   metadata   after   the   fact,   um,   on   whether   or   not   this   is,   you   know,   misinformation   or   it's   just   really   viral   content,   like,   uh,   you   know,   someone   did   something   great   (laughs) ,   you   know?   You   see   those   videos   on   Facebook   all   the   time,   like   someone   doing   something   sweet   for   a   stranger.   Those   are-   that's-   personally,   that's-   that's   one   of   my   favorite   things   to   see   on   these   social   platforms   is-  
**Interviewer:** Cool.  
**Candidate:** ...   is   good   people   doing   good   things.   Um,   and-   and-   and,   you   know,   when   you   do   see   a   good   person   doing   a   good   thing,   you   will   see   a   lot   more   up   votes   than   you   will   down   votes,   right?   And-   and   that's   why   as,   you   know,   maybe   a   second,   uh,   correlation,   um,   you   know,   s-   second   metrics   to   check   is   like,   you   know,   what-   what   is   the   likes   to   dislikes   ratio,   and   what's,   you   know,   maybe   multiply   that   by   the   total   engagement,   um,   because   of   what   I-   I   said   earlier   in   terms   of   divisiveness   and   misinformation   associated   with   divisiveness,   things   like   that.  
**Interviewer:** Absolutely.   Uh,   I   know   that   earlier,   you   wanted   to   surface   some   ideas.   Did   you   want   to   talk   briefly   about   that   before   we   close   the   interview?  
**Candidate:** Um,   yeah,   in   terms   of   ideas   for   products,   I   mean,   I-   I-   I   do   feel   like,   you   know,   it-   it   would   be   difficult,   uh,   after   the   fact   to   actually   create   like   enough,   um,   uh,   a-   a-   a   large   enough   data   set   to   do   any   meaningful   machine   learning,   um,   but,   you   know,   we   have   a   lot   of   research,   uh,   on   fact   checkers,   you   know,   so   we   could   at   least   start   to,   um...   start   to   build   a-   a   decent   sized   database   of,   you   know,   here   are   all   the   inputs,   um,   in   terms   of   the   main   metrics   that   we've   listed   out,   and   this   is   misinformation   or   not,   just   like   a   binary   classifier.   Um,   and   use   that   as   a   way   to   potentially,   not   completely   replace   the   need   for,   uh,   um,   for-   for-   for   a   team   of   fact   checkers,   um,   which   is   probably   the   worst   job   in   the   world,   by   the   way.   I   feel   for   those   people.   Um,   but   at   least   support   their   efforts,   you   know?   So   it-   it   could-   it   could   be   the-   the-   the,   um,   just   something   that...   a-   a   tool   that   they   reach   for,   um,   to   help   scale   them   and-   and   to   make   their   job   a   little   bit   easier.   Um,   I   feel   like   that'd   be   a-   a-   a   useful   tool   to-   to   have   at   Facebook,   um,   in   terms   of,   you   know,   being   able   to   identify   misinformation   before   it-   before   it   surfaces,   before   it   goes   completely   viral.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome,   Stephen.   So   this   is   a   great   answer.   Um,   I'd   love   to   give   you   an   opportunity   to   provide   some   self-feedback   and   any   tips   that   you   want   to   give   the   audience   as   well-  
**Candidate:** Sure.  
**Interviewer:** ...   in   terms   of   just   general   PM   interviewing.  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   um,   I   mean,   I   think   that   I   wanted   to   turn   into   a   product   question.   Uh,   this   was   very   obviously   a   metrics   question.   Um,   I   think   metrics   questions   are   a   little   bit   easier   than   product   questions,   at   least   in   my   experience.   They-   they...   I-   I've   had   more   success   with   them,   um,   but,   uh,   but,   you   know,   I-   I   recognized   that   pretty   early   on.   All   right,   you   know,   reel   it   back,   focus   on   the   metrics.   This   is,   you   know...   And-   and   I   think   you   did   a   great   job   of,   um,   bringing   me   back   to   the   actual   question   at   hand,   um,   so,   so   that-   that's   my   thought   on   the...   on-   on   like   the-   the   question   answer.   Um,   I   have   some   like   general   feedback,   but   we   can   do   that-   we   can   do   that   later   or...  
**Interviewer:** Sure,   yeah.   So   I   think   one   thing   that   I   would   do   differently   is   include   the   mission   of   Facebook   and   think   about   how   this   problem   relates   to   the   mission,   if   it's   derailing   us   from   the   miss-   mission   or   if   it's   good   for   the   mission,   but   it's   bad   for   PR.   I   think   there's   several   different   ways   to   think   about   how   this   fits   into   the   mission.   Uh,   I-   I   liked   how   you   talked   about   the   users.   I   liked   how   you   went   through   and   you   listed   some   pretty   interesting   metrics.   One   that   I   would   have   included   is...   so   this   one   would   be   sort   of   a   supplementary   metric,   I   think   you   were   on   the   right   track   in   terms   of   a   North   Star,   but   one   that   I   would   have   thought   about   was   the   ratio   of-   of   like   comments   to   the   likes.   Perhaps   there's   a-   a   hypothesis   that   you   can   make   where   users   or   audience   members   who   are   talking   more   than   liking   something,   maybe   it-   it's   a   controversial   type   of   content.   I   think   that's   something   that,   uh,   you   know,   we   could   have   talked   about.   Um,   but   overall   this   is   a   great   answer   and   I'd   love   to   give   you   the   stage   if   you   have   any   general   PM   interviewing   advice.  
**Candidate:** Um,   yeah,   thanks   for-   thanks   for   that   feedback.   Um,   yeah,   any   general   feedback,   um,   just   I   can   really   only   speak   to   my   experience.   Um-And   what   I've   been   telling   people   since   I've   gone   through   this   process   is   that,   you   know,   practice   is   so,   so   important.   Um,   being   able   to,   uh,   take   the   most   mundane   idea   and   turn   it   into   an   interesting   product,   I   feel   like   is-   is   such   a   cool   skill   to   have,   and   it's-   it's   one   that   I've   just   started   to-   to-   to   hone   myself.   Uh,   but   I'll   like   walk   around.   I   live   in   Denver.   I'll   walk   around   Denver   and   I'll   look   at   a-   the   street   lamp   and   I'll   think,   "How   can   I   improve   that?"   And   then   I'll   go   through   the,   you   know,   the   Circles   methodology   or,   you   know,   uh,   a-   any   of   the   others   that   you-   you   read   out   there,   um,   on   places   like   Exponent   and   stuff.   Um,   and   I   say   practice   'cause   it-   it'll   give   you   the   confidence   to,   um,   to-   to-   to   really   present   yourself   in   the   best   light.   Uh,   I   remember   when   I   did   my   first   phone   interview   with   Google.   Uh,   I   had,   uh,   just   the   worst   product   pitch,   um,   but   I   was,   uh,   confident   (laughs)   in   that   pitch,   um,   and   I   also,   uh,   I-   I   was   comfortable   enough   to   show   some   empathy.   Um,   I   think   that's   the   reason   why   I   advanced.   Um,   so   just   practicing   being   yourself.   Have   fun   with   it.   Um,   I   think   a   lot   of   people   freeze   up   in   the   interview   process,   um,   but   if   you   make   it   interactive,   um,   it   makes   it   fun   for   the   person   who's   interviewing   you.   So   let   them   talk,   let   them   think,   let   them   encourage   you,   get   them   on   your   side.   Talk   about,   you   know,   us   and   we,   uh,   and   together,   these   types   of   things.   I   think   that   that   goes-   that   goes   a   long   way.   Um,   and   you   know,   the   last   thing   I'd   say   is   that,   um,   you   know,   just,   uh-   just,   you   know,   when   you   are   interviewing,   this-   this   might   be,   uh-   uh,   more   true   later   on,   you   know,   after   you've   had   a   couple   of   years,   um,   but   engage   with   the   PM   network.   I   have   had   such   a   great   experience   reaching   out   to   not   only   friends   who   are   PMs,   but   strangers.   Maybe   they   went   to   the   same   college   as   me   or   they   live   in   the   same   city.   Um,   but   engage   with   them   and   have   them   recommend   you   for   the   job.   Like,   uh,   I   had   great   success   with   like   the   big   companies   because   I   went   in   through   a-   a   friend,   um,   or   someone   I   went   to   college   with.   But   there   were   companies,   in   my   case,   where   I   just   applied   that   you'd   never   heard   of   and   they   never   wrote   me   back.   So   really   work   your   network,   um,   and-   and   like,   of   course,   be,   uh,   cognizant   of   their   time.   Um,   but,   uh,   people   wanna   help,   so   help   them   help   you.  
**Interviewer:** Referrals   are   a   great   way.   And   thanks   for   the   advice,   Stephen.
