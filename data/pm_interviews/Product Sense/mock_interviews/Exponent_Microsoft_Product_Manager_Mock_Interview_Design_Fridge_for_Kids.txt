**Interviewer:** ...   design   a   refrigerator   for   kids.   (instrumental music)   Hey,   everyone.   I'm   super   excited   to   be   here   today   with   Diego   to   do   a   product   management   mock   interview.   But   before   we   jump   into   it,   Diego,   could   you   tell   us   a   little   bit   more   about   yourself?  
**Candidate:** Absolutely.   Thank   you   so   much,   Stephen,   for   inviting   me.   Hello,   everyone.   My   name   is   Diego   Granados,   and   I'm   currently   a   product   manager   for   Microsoft,   working   on   AI   and   machine   learning.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome.   And   well,   we're   super   excited   to   have   you   here,   Diego,   to   do   a   mock   interview   today.   And   we're   gonna   be   doing   something   a   little   different   today,   where   Diego's   not   only   going   to   be   answering   the   question,   but   we   wanted   to   hear   a   little   bit   more   about   what   Diego's   thought   process   is   as   he   goes   through   the   question   and   sort   of   an   explanation   of   why   he's   going   through   that.   So   we're   gonna   try   out   this   method   that   will   hopefully   give   you   an   even   deeper   dive   into   how   to   answer   the   interview   questions,   um,   that   product   managers   must   face   in   the   interviews.   Um,   so   I'm   super   excited   to   jump   into   it,   uh,   and   I'll   go   ahead   and   ask   the   question,   Diego,   and   we   can   get   started   whenever   you're   ready.   The   question   that   I'd   like   to   ask   you   today   is,   design   a   refrigerator   for   kids.  
**Candidate:** Absolutely.   Thanks,   Stephen.   So,   um,   y-   before   I   jump   into   answering   the   question,   I,   I   think   that   one   of   the   most   common   mistakes   that   I   see   candidates   do   at   this   moment   is   they   start   rushing   into   addressing   how   would   they   improve   it.   So   before   I   start   thinking   about   solutions   for   users,   uh,   the   first   thing   that   I   need   to   think   about   is,   uh,   I   want   to   fully   understand   the   problem.   And,   and   just   to   give   you   an   idea,   here   are   a   few   questions   that   I   would   ask   in   an   interview.   Okay,   um,   so   before   jumping   into   solving   this   problem   about   the   fridge   for,   for   kids   in   mind,   let   me   ask   you   a   few   questions,   Stephen.   So,   uh,   what   type   of   company   are   we?   Should   I   assume   that   we're   like,   you   know,   a   large   company   like   Microsoft   or   Google   or   a   startup?   Like,   what   type   of   company   are   we?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   for   the   intents   and   purposes   of   this   exercise,   you   can   assume   we're   a   connected   appliance   company   of   some   sort   that   has   access   to   tools   like   data,   AI,   and   cloud   technologies.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   and   since   we   are   this,   you   know,   sort   of   new-type   of   company,   do   we   have   any,   any   constraints,   any   limits   on   our   resources?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   for   the   exercise   that   we're   gonna   do   today,   let's   imagine   that   we   don't   have   that   many   constraints.   We   have   a   substantial   amount   of   resources   to   design   this   refrigerator.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   and   this   is   the   first   time   that   I   hear   something   about   this.   So   I'm   assuming   that,   you   know,   we're   a   new   company,   this   is   our   first   design.   So   I   think   our   goal   should   be   to   enter   the   market   and,   and   just   gain   market   share.   Is,   is   that   a,   a   good   goal   for   you,   or   do   you   prefer   to   go   after   something   else?  
**Interviewer:** That   sounds   great.   Yes,   let's   imagine   that   we're   first   to   the   market   for   something   like   this.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   So   in   a   real   interview,   I   would,   uh,   try   to   clarify   many   more   things,   right?   Uh,   as   many   as,   as   I   w-   need   to   until   I   fully   understand   the   prompt   and   the   limitations.   But   for   now,   let's   go   with   these   questions.   And   the   next   thing   that   I   want   to   do   is   I   wanna   make   sure   that   the   interviewer   and   I   are   on   the   same   page.   So   what   I'm   gonna   do   next   is   I'm   gonna   talk   a   little   bit   about   my   experience   with   fridges.   It   sounds   obvious,   but   you,   you   can   think   of   how   incredibly   powerful   that   is.   So,   uh,   Stephen,   you   know,   like   most   of   the   people   out   there,   I   do   have   a   fridge   at,   at   home,   and   it   came   with   my   apartment.   And   while   I   don't   have   kids,   I've,   I've   had   my   nephews   and   nieces   around,   and,   uh,   you   know,   the   first   thing   that   I   noticed   is   that,   um,   there's   no   fridge   that   is   designed   for   kids   in   mind.   And   so   while   yes,   there   are   many   competitors   for   fridges,   I'm   gonna   assume   that   we   actually   don't   have   a   competitor.   This   is,   you   know,   first   in   class,   so   we   don't   have   to   worry   yet   about,   uh,   features   from   our   competitors,   and   we'll   start,   uh,   you   know,   with   a   fresh   new   design   of   a   fridge   with   the   kids   designed...   uh,   sorry,   with   the   kids   in   mind,   uh,   as   we   go   through   the   design.   Now,   um,   as   we   talk   about   kids,   we   also   have   to   think   about   parents.   So   the   next   thing   that   I   wanna   do,   if   that's   okay   with   you,   I   wanna   go   into   brainstorming   a   little   bit   about   users.   There   are   multiple   segments   about,   you   know,   when   we   think   about   kids,   and   we   also   have   to   think   about   parents.   Would   that   be   okay   for   you,   or   is   there   anything   else   that   you   wa-   that   you   want   to   talk   about?  
**Interviewer:** Thanks   for   checking   in.   No,   that   sounds   great.   Let's   go   for   it.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   So,   uh,   now   before   breaking   down   into   the   different   segments   and   talking   about   it,   in   an   interview,   what   I   would   do   next   is   I   would   ask   Stephen   for   some   time,   take   a   couple   minutes,   write   things   down.   I   would   ask   something   like,   "Hey,   Stephen,   would   it   be   okay   if   I   take   a   couple   of   minutes?"   Typically,   interviewers   will   say   yes.   So   take   a   piece   of   paper,   write   things   down,   and   as   soon   as   you're   done,   start   talking.   And,   um,   once   you   have   that,   you   can   start   with   something   like,   "All   right,   um,   Stephen,   so   I   have-   I   thought   of   a   few   users."   Um,   first   of   all,   we've   got,   like   I   mentioned   before,   we,   we   have   parents.   Uh,   while   kids   may   be   users,   parents   will   typically   be   the   customers.   And   in   this   case,   they're   also   going   to   be   users.   So   that's   one   segment   that   we   need   to   think   about.   Then   when   we   talk   about   kids,   we   have   kids   at   multiple   stages   in   life,   and   so   I   wanna   focus   on   elementary,   because   I   think   that's   where   we,   you   know,   we   can   have   the   most   impact   on.   And,   um,   typically,   we   can   break   that   down   into   other   types   of   sec-   segments.   We   could   go   to,   you   know,   kids   who   are   i-   in   high   school   or   even   younger.   But   I   wanna   mention   one   specific   that   is   typically   left   out   in   interviews,   and   that   is,   uh,   kids   again   in   elementary   who   have   to   use   a   wheelchair.   Uh,   I   think   it's   an   important   segment,   and   I'll   consider   them,   but,   um,   these   are   my   three   groups   of   users.   Now,   the   next   thing   in   an   interview   that   I   would   do   is   I   would   select   one   of   these   groups   and   tell   Stephen   why   I'm   selecting   that   group,   and   that's   what   I'm   gonna   do   next.   Um,   so   Stephen,   from   these   three   groups   that   I   mentioned,   I   think   that   we   should   go   after   the   kids   that   are   in   elementary   school,   and   I   think   that   because   since   we're   a   new   company   with   a   new   product,   we   have   to   make   a   big   impact,   and   I   think   that's   where   we   have   our   biggest   market   share.   Is   that   okay   if   we   explore   that   segment,   or   would   you   be   interested   in   another   one?  
**Interviewer:** That   sounds   great,   and,   uh,   thanks   for   taking   the   time   to   break   it   down.   Just   wanted   to   add,   pausing,   one   of   the   most   important   things   to   do   in   an   interview,   and   I'm   glad   you,   you   called   that   out,   Diego.   Um,   a-   around   two   minutes   is   around   the   normal   amount   for   a   pause.   Um,   but   yeah,   please,   um,   that   sounds   like   a   great   user   segment.   Let's,   let's   go   for   it   and   dig   deeper.  
**Candidate:** Absolutely.   Thank   you.   Um,   okay,   in   an   interview,   in   this   next   step,   uh,   the   one   thing   that   I   wanna   think   about,   and   I   can   tell   my   interviewer,   is   something   like,   "Hey,   Stephen.   Okay,   now   that   we   have   our   users,   the   next   thing   that   I   wanna   do   is   just   take   a   little   bit   of   time   to   brainstorm   some   pain   points."   And   again,   take   one   or   two   minutes,   and   if   you   think   you're   running   out   of   time,   start   talking   of   the   things   that   you   have   written   down   and   continue   writing   as   you   talk.   But   don't   take   too   much   time.   It-   y-   you   don't   want   that   awkward   silence   of,   you   know,   five   minutes.   So-...   take   your   time,   brainstorm   some   ideas,   write   them   down,   and,   you   know,   you   can   show   at   the   interview,   or   hey,   you   know,   just   to   give   an   idea,   "Here's   a   few   things   that   I'm   writing   about   in   terms   of   users   and   pain   points."   And,   um,   once   you're   ready,   start   talking.   All   right,   um,   Stephen,   so   I   thought   about   this,   you   know,   group   of   users   and,   um,   I   thought   about   three   different   pain   points   that,   that   we   can   have   for   these,   for   these,   um,   kids   who   are   in   elementary   school.   So   one   of   them   is   that   when   kids,   um,   go   to   the   fridge   and   they   open   it,   they   typically   go   for,   you   know,   snacks   and   whether   that   is   something   like   ice   cream   or   just   any   sugary   snack   that   they   can   find.   And   a   lot   of   times   is   they're   hungry,   they   want   something,   and   they   see   the   fridge   wi-   which   is   very   confusing   for   them.   We   see   containers,   we   see   raw   food.   They   have   no   idea   what   to   do   with   those,   so   they   go   for   the   easy   option.   So,   one   of   the   pain   points   is   about   not   knowing   exactly   what's,   you   know,   inside   the   fridge.   The   second   is   a   little   bit   more   concerning   to   the   parents,   but   I   think   it's   still   a   pain   point   for   both   kids   and   parents,   which   is,   yes,   um,   even   if   we   had,   you   know,   the   healthy   food,   let's   say   carrots   in   a   bowl   and   the   kid   could   easily   take   them   out   and   start   eating   some   carrots,   um,   they're   always   going   to   prefer,   you   know,   ice   cream   over   carrots.   So   even   if   we   make   it   simple,   that's   still   a   pain   point   because   over   time   that   could   impact   the   health   of   the   kids.   Um,   and,   and   the   last   one,   and,   and   this,   you   know,   happened   with   my   nieces,   and   by   the   way,   quick   parenthesis,   it's   always   important   if   you   have   a   personal   story   to   add   it   into   the   mix.   Uh,   one   of   my   nieces   was   taking   out   a   bowl   out   of   the   fridge   and   it   fell,   uh,   through   her   hands.   It   was   made   out   of   glass   and,   of   course,   it   was   dangerous.   Nothing   happened,   but   I   feel   that   kids,   if   they're   moving   stuff   around,   you   know,   it   could   be   potentially   dangerous.   So   I   have   these   three   pain   points.   The   next   thing   that   I   want   to   do   is   think   of   how   can   I   solve   this?   But   before   that,   let   me   pause   here   and   see   if   you   got   any   questions   for   me.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   Um,   thanks   for,   for   checking   in   with   me.   I   mean,   this   sounds   like   a   great   discussion.   You   can   keep   going   for   it.   I   would   love   to   hear   how   you'd   solve   some   of   these   pain   points   when   you're   ready   to,   to   get   to   that   step.  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   absolutely.   Okay.   Before,   again,   br-   going   into   how   do   I   solve   these   pain   points,   I   need   to   take   some   time,   and   I   need   to   just   take   some   time   to,   uh,   brainstorm   how   would   I   solve   these   pain   points.   In,   in   many   interviews,   you'll   come   up   with   two,   three,   maybe   four   solutions,   and   what   you   want   to   make   sure   is   that   if   you're   interviewing   in   a   video   call   like   this   one,   you   can   typically   have   a   paper   that   you   can   show   your   interviewer   what,   the,   the   steps   that   you're   doing.   If   it's   over   the   phone,   you   want   to   make   sure   that,   you   know,   you   use   things   like   first   to   second   and   third   to   make   sure   that   it's   clear   and   how   many,   uh,   solutions   you   have.   If   you   have   moonshot   ideas,   which   is   a,   you   know,   typically   common   in   an   interview   like   with   Google,   you   also   want   to   make   sure   that   you,   you   call   them   out.   Don't   be   afraid   to   explore   different   ideas.   You'll   get   later   into   things   like   prioritizing   and,   and   measuring,   and   so   don't   worry   about   if   your   idea   sounds   a   little   bit   crazy.   The   whole   point   of   this   exercise   is   to   show   that   you   can   mix,   uh,   the   user,   the   pain   point   with   a   little   bit   of   creativity   and   solve   the   problem.   It's   about   solving   the   user   pain   point,   not   about   just   making   the   product   f-   uh,   the   product   cool   for   the   sake   of   making   it   cool.   So,   take   your   time,   brainstorm   two   minutes,   and   then   start   talking   again.   Um,   okay.   So,   um,   Stephen,   I   thought   about,   you   know,   a   few   ways   to   solve   these   three   pain   points,   right?   Uh,   the   first   solution   that   I   can   think   of   is   a   little   bit   related   to,   um,   you   know,   my   nieces   dropped   this   object,   it   can   be   dangerous   and,   and   parents   will   be   concerned   about   that.   And   so   one   thing   that   I   can   think   of   is   we   can   actually   have   special   compartments   inside   the   fridge   that,   uh,   parents   can   lock   or   unlock   and   anything   that   could   be   harmful   or   they   can   break,   they   can   simply   put   it,   you   know,   on   that   part   o-   of   the   fridge   and,   and   if   the   parents   are   not   around,   they   need   to   open   it   for   somebody   else   through   an   app,   they   can   simply   touch   a   button,   open   it   up,   people   can   take   out   the   container,   uh,   but   it   will   be   safe   for   kids   and   they   can   just   leave   the   snacks   and,   you   know,   healthy   stuff   somewhere   else   where   it's   not   part   of   that,   you   know,   special   containment,   con-   uh,   special   door   or,   or   special   part   of   the   fridge.   So   that's   one   solution   that   I   can   think   of   for   how   we   can   help,   uh,   mitigate   that   the   kids   could,   you   know,   uh,   get   harmed   if   they   drop   something.   Another   solution   that   I   have,   my   second   solution   for,   for   a   pain   point   of   kids,   you   know,   may   always   choose   actually   the   sugary   snacks   over   the   healthy   stuff   is   we   can   think   of   gamifying   the   experience   of   the   fridge.   So   for   instance,   if   we   have,   say,   um,   a,   a   display   in   the   front   of   the   fridge   where   kids   can   log   in,   you   know,   something   simple,   something   like,   uh,   finger,   fingerprint   scanning,   uh,   or,   you   know,   any   other   way   we   can,   we   can   explore,   but   essentially   I   log   in   as   a   kid   and   I'm   gonna   receive   points.   The   fridge   can   detect   if   I   took   out,   say,   an   ice   cream   or,   uh,   some   carrots   or   something   else   healthy.   If   I   take   something,   you   know,   healthy,   I   can   gain   points.   If   I   take   something   sugary   more   than,   you   know,   one   for   one   portion   of   it,   uh,   I   can   get,   you   know,   less   points   for   that   or   reduced   points.   Now   about   the   points,   what   I   can   do   as   a   parent   then   is   I   can   say,   "Well,   you   want   a,   you   know,   extra   half   an   hour   of   video   games?   It   costs   100   points."   And   so   as   a   kid,   I'm   incentivized   to   actually   if   I   want   to   play   more   I   can,   you   know,   I   need   to   go   for   the   healthy   food.   And   so   in   time,   this   addresses   the   concern   of,   uh,   the   parents   saying,   "Hey,   my   kid   is   not   being   healthy."   And   the   third   idea   that   I   have   is   a   little   bit   related   to   if   I   open   the   fridge   as   a   kid,   I   have   no   idea   what's   in   there,   right?   Now,   what   if   we   go   a   little   bit   crazy   on   this   one   and   say,   "As   a   parent,   I   want   the   fridge   to   understand   different   recipes."   I   will   put   into   the   fridge,   "Hey,   I   know   they   have   this,   you   know,   vegetables   and,   and   I   want   this   type   of   salad   that   I   know   my   kid   likes."   So   I   can   simply   put   the   recipe   and   as   soon   as   the   kid   opens   it,   the   fridge   has   like   a   special   compartment,   so   this   is   what   we're   designing.   I   put   all   the   raw   ingredients   there,   the   kid   opens   the   fridge.   Uh,   this   compartment   mixes   everything,   prepares   or   maybe   we   can   even   go   crazier   and   say   it   can   actually   heat   a   few   things,   and   as   soon   as   the   kid   opens   it   up,   it   will   serve   that,   that   plate   to   the   kid.   And   so   the   kid   instead   of   trying   to   fish   for   what's   out   there,   it   will,   you   know,   be   like,   "Hey,   here's   your   food.   It's   healthy.   It's   a   snack.   You   love   it.   Uh,   your   parents   know   about   it."   And   so   the   kid   simply   takes   the   plate   out   from   that   special   compartment   and,   you   know,   be   done   with   it.   And   so   that   I   think   we   can   address,   uh,   that   can   also   address,   um,   how......   uh,   the   kids   can   say,   "I   understand   what's   inside   the   fridge."   At   this   point,   before   moving   forward,   you   can   also,   again,   if   you're   doing   a   video   call,   you   can   show   your   interviewer,   "Hey,   here   are   my   three   ideas.   Here   are   the   pain   points.   Here's   how   I'm   solving   everything."   It   just   gives   them   a   good   idea   of   how   you're   thinking,   structuring   the   problem,   and   also   helps   them   to   follow   you   along,   uh,   as   you're   talking   through,   through   the   solution.   And,   and   so   before   continuing   the,   the,   the   prompt   with   your   interviewer,   uh,   again,   check   in   just   to   make   sure   that   they   don't   have   questions   or   that   they   don't   wanna   go   deeper   into   a   solution.   So   you   can   simply   say   something   like,   "All   right,   um,   so,   Stephen,   so   these   were   my   three   ideas   to   the   pain   points.   Uh,   what   I'd   love   to   do   next   is   explore,   uh,   how   we   can   prioritize   these,   these   ideas,   but   before   I   go   there,   uh,   do   you   have   any   questions,   any   comments   on   any   of   the   things   that   I   mentioned   before?"  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   Um,   well,   I'd   love   to   hear   a   little   bit   more   a-   about   the   point   system   that   you   mentioned,   um,   in   just   a   second,   and   specifically   on,   um,   you   know,   the   video   game-like   experience   that   you'd   be   creating   for   kids   and   maybe   some   concerns   that   you   might   have   at,   with   it   as   well.   Um,   so   I'd   love   to   hear   some   thoughts   on   the   concerns   of   that.   Um,   also,   you   know,   just   to   comment   from   a   non-interviewer's   perspective,   I   think   Diego's   doing   a   great   job   of   checking   in.   Um,   I,   I,   what   I   really   like   about   the   paper   is   not   even   necessarily   that   I   need   to   be   able   to   read   it.   I   know   it's   hard   to   read   on   this,   uh,   video   call,   but   what's   h-   effective   that   Diego's   doing   is   he's   spatially   placing   his   ideas   so   he   can   point   to   them.   So   he   can   say   like,   "Oh,   this   is   my   first   one,   this   is   the   second   one.   This   one's   this   one,   and   this   one's   that   one."   And   even   just   the   mere   act   of,   like,   spatially   placing   out   things   and   delineating   them   helps   me   as   an   interviewer   understand   a   little   bit   more   about   what   Diego's   getting   at.   So   just   wanted   to   call   that   out   as   being   something,   uh,   quite   effective.   But   yeah,   Diego,   would   love   to   hear   a   little   bit   more   about,   um,   maybe   concerns.   Like,   let's   say   I'm   a   parent   and   I'm   imagining   this   game-like   system,   um,   and   then   maybe   my   concern   is   that,   you   know,   like,   after   this   game   system   is   done   or   maybe   we're   traveling   on   vacation   or   something   like   that,   I   have   no   mechanism   to   get   my   kid   to   eat.   Um,   so,   uh,   how   would   you   think   about   that   particular   idea   in   the   context   of   that?   And   then   yes,   please   go   on   to,   to   tell   me   which   idea   you   think   would   be   the   best   to   kinda   dig   deeper   into.  
**Candidate:** Absolutely.   Uh,   before   I   go   into   the   answer,   uh,   stepping   back   a   little   bit   in,   into,   into   the   interview   itself,   uh,   I   think   this   is   great   example   of   why   memorizing   a   framework,   it's   not   the   right   way   to   approach   these   problems.   You   have   to   understand   the   concepts   of   the   frameworks,   like,   uh,   customers,   customers   have   pain   points,   pain   points   provoke   solutions.   But   i-   if   I   just   memorize   the   framework   an-   and   Stephen   as-   asks   me   this,   this   question,   I   would   be   nervous   because   it's   not   part   of   the   framework.   Like,   it   was   something   that   I   didn't   expect.   So   i-   it's   not   about   you   have   to   learn   A,   B,   or   C   framework.   It's   you   have   to   understand   the   concepts   behind   the   framework   to   help   you   think   like   a   product   manager   as   you   go   through   these   interviews.   So,   um,   going   back   to   the   answer.   All   right,   so,   so,   Stephen,   so   you're   absolutely   right.   I   think,   um,   if,   if   I   actually   think   of,   for   instance,   my   mom   w-   having   that   system   not   only   with   me   but   with   my   nieces,   my   nieces   were   born   with   a   tablet   in   their   hand,   they   know   how   systems   work,   they   can   actually,   you   know,   find   a   way   to,   uh,   m-   I   don't   know,   uh,   make   sure   that   they   are   actually   taking   sugary   snacks   and   trick   the   system   into   thinking   it's,   it's   vegetables.   And   so,   uh,   uh,   I   think   yes,   while   the   system   is   designed   for   kids,   my   main   concern   is   that   adults   have   to   be   able   to   use   it.   So   we   have   to   make   sure   that   whatever   we   design,   it's,   um,   you   know,   being   usable   by   parents,   by   kids,   by   anyone   regardless   of   their   age.   So   that's   one   principle   that   we   always   have   to   keep   in   mind.   Um,   another   concern   that   I   have   is   that,   uh,   with   many   things   that,   that   we've   seen   through,   you   know,   mobile   apps,   games   or   websites,   at   some   point   you   get   tired   of   these   things,   right?   And,   and   the   kid   could   say   like,   "Uh,   whatever,   I   just   don't   care   about   30   more   minutes   of   gameplay,"   or,   "I   don't   care   about   the   system   anymore,   I'll   just   take   whatever."   So   we   have   to   think   that   this   is   not   something   that   we   design   once   and,   and   that's   it,   boom,   great   idea.   It's   something   that   we   need   to   keep   iterating   on   and   we   need   to   keep   iterating   on,   on   the   user   feedback   to   understand   what   the   kids   want   to   do,   uh,   whether   it's,   you   know,   just   a   points   system   or   a   rewards   system.   How   do   we   improve   that   gamifying   experience?   So   we...   This   is   not   a   one   thing   implementation.   This   is   a   long-term   thing.   And,   and   the   last,   and   addressing   your   concern   about,   hey,   uh,   you   know,   we   went   to   vacation,   what's   gonna   happen?   Um,   and   we   can   think   of   different   ways.   We   are   talking   about   connected   appliances,   right?   So   in   the   future,   we   might   have   multiple   appliances,   so   we   can   start   thinking   of   a   design   where,   um,   we   have   something   that   goes   with   us   along   the   way   in   terms   of,   um,   I   may   be   a   parent,   I   have   a   mobile   app   here   on   my   phone   that   helps   me   with   that   point   system.   And,   and   so   we   can   make   games   with   the   family,   uh,   as,   as   we   are,   you   know,   educating   our   kids,   although   I   have   to   warn   here   that   it's   not   j-   the   life   is   not   just   about   gamifying,   right?   But   it's,   uh,   a   good   way   to   introduce   some   family   dynamics   that   could   also   help,   like,   with   the,   with   the   chores   and,   and   just   helping   out,   you   know,   getting   points   and   all   that.   It's,   it's   a   matter   of,   of   also   families   in   here.   So   i-   in   the   end   is,   is   how   do   we   extend   that   beyond   the   fridge   and   just   saying,   uh,   as   you   go   on   vacation,   uh,   the   system   has   to   know   that   you're   on   vacation,   that,   uh,   y-   you   know,   the   family's   not   present,   but   as   they   come   back,   how   do   I   incorporate   the   points   that   maybe   I,   I,   I   won   on   the   travel   and   then   coming   back,   uh,   home   and,   and   continuing   that?   So   these   are   some   of   the   concerns   that,   that   I   have,   and   those   are   just   around   the   user,   but   of   course   technological   speaking,   it's   a,   it's   a   different   story.   (laughs Got it. Um, thanks for diving into that. That makes a lot of sense. Um, would love to hear a little bit more about the detailed solution that you do think would be valuable to discuss a little bit more in this particular problem. Yeah. So, eh, going back, uh, to, to where we were talking about before is now that I have my three different, uh, solutions, I, I think it's important that we prioritize them. And, and we have to think about prioritizing, um, is not just about saying, "Oh, this is the most feasible one," or, "This is the one that just has the most impact." Prioritizing, there are tons of frameworks, there are tons of things that we can do about prioritizing. But to me the important keys are first of all, we need to make sure that we address the objective, which in our case is about, uh, getting that market share. And second, we have to make sure that, um, our solutions...... addressed the pain points and we prioritized based on that. And I have a third one, uh, which applies to hardware, uh, which is it's way easier to implement hardware first and then make software updates, versus if I buy a fridge today and then I made a hardware update, uh, I'm probably not gonna, you know, replace my fridge in the next five, 10 years. Um, so, so I have to keep those things in mind. And so with that in mind, um, like I said, so if you're in an interview, you can show here are my three ideas. You can say, "Well, um, you know, I think that we should prioritize first the idea of gamifying the fridge, adding this, uh, screen in the front, and I think that's where we could have the most impact at the beginning of launching this new, uh, fridge into the market. It's connected, so once we implement this, any new upgrades that we can do in software are gonna be relatively easier." So that's the first one that I would do. And this would, again, address the pain point of, of making sure that kids try to eat healthier. The second one would be about the concern of, um, kids may drop something if it's made ou- out of, uh, you know, glass or something that could be hurtful for them. And the reason I say that it could be second is because from a technology point of view, this could also be an add-on module, so it's not something that we need to implement today. We can actually, you know, get a new revenue li- revenue stream through that, uh, sold separately, something that, that we can add on at a later stage. And the third one about having a special compartment that can prepare the food, I think that could be, uh, like a next huge gen of fridges, uh, in the smart home appliances, but it's something that requires a lot of technology. So while I put it as a third option, that doesn't mean that we need to start it at last. We can start with research and development today and plan for it, you know, in the next five, 10 years as the next generation of fridges. And, and so that's how I would prioritize these three things. The next thing or the last thing that I love to do just to make sure that, that we, um, we, we enclose the, the, this case is to tell you about how I would measure the success of, of these implementation. But before that, any other questions that you have? Nope, that sounds great, Diego. Um, yeah, would love to hear your metric for success. Yeah. So, uh, and again, in an interview, if you need time, take, you know, ask for a minute or two. Uh, you don't wanna make it 10 minutes of silence, just something brief. And once you have your metrics, then you can start talking, uh, to your interviewer. All right. So I have these three solutions. Uh, I prioritized them. And the first thing that I need to think about is since we're selling a fridge, which is something physical, one of the metrics that I would go, uh, to is, um, the sales and also the returns, and I would include into that the service call or support calls because we wanna make sure, yes, how much are we selling, how much we are returning, but also how many people are calling support for, you know, X, Y, Z problem. That will give us an idea of are people buying it? Are people actually not happy and returning it? Or are we having too many problems with that? So that's one metric that I would measure to determine whether this has been a successful implementation. Another set of metrics is online signals. And so when I think of a product, if I'm buying something on a website like Amazon or Walmart, uh, I look at the reviews and I look at the comments from people, right? So I will look at through the channels where we are distributing this fridge if we have an online presence, let's look at the reviews, let's look at how, what people are, uh, commenting on our solution. And, and I would also s- take that as a signal of whether we, uh, we are being successful and more people are adopting that, and of course, that includes the sales, the returns, and, and the support calls. And lastly, once we have those two I would say primary metrics, I would also look at telemetry metrics or metrics from our product. How are people using it? And this is something that, you know, through the right privacy and, and, um, legal requirements, we can take the signals from the fridge and see, okay, how are people actually using it? Are, are, are kids, uh, enjoying the gamifying experience? Are people being constant about it? Um, are, are, are people actually... or are there any malfunctions in the program? Any bugs? And so this combination of three different types of metrics, I think can give us a good indication of whether this was a successful implementation or not Got it. Um, that's an awesome, uh, recap or sort of ending to that exercise, Diego. Could you maybe summarize kind of like the steps that you went through to get there or, um, anything else that you think would be valuable to add in this interview before we break out of the interview? Absolutely. And, um, speaking of, of the interview, so i- if I were in an interview at this moment and I see that I have a little bit of time, one, one nice touch, uh, I don't think many interviewers like Stephen, uh, ask sometimes for a recap, but I think it's a really nice touch that interviewers or interviewees sometimes do that. And, and just take a couple minutes and, and go over all the different steps, right? Uh, you can do something like this in this case. Um, sure. So we started with our, you know, problem of how do we design a, a fridge for kids in mind. We clarify a few questions like, "Yes, we are a startup that is in charge of, uh, smart appliances." We also clarified our constraints and the goal of entering the market with this new product. We talked about kids, but also as part of the users, we talk about parents and another segment of kids who use wheelchairs, and we decided to go with kids who are in elementary school because it's where we can make the biggest impact for this new product. So we talked about three pain points then, being able to identify what's in the fridge, being able to, um, help with the kids' health by helping them to choose, um-... healthy food over snacks, and finally being able to be, uh, to have some safety around containers that, that may break easily. Then we brainstorm. Uh, once we have those pain points, we brainstorm on the solutions, and the solutions were gamifying the system to allow the kid to, uh, have a better health through, through points and, and exchange that for things like more, more, more time playing. We also talked about, uh, having this, you know, compartment that prepares the food, and we also talked about having an extra layer of protection that parents can put in, in front of the fridge for containers that are made of glass. We prioritize them by saying, "First, gamify, second, this, uh, extra layer of protection, and third, um, the container." And we're gonna measure the success of this implementation by, um, measuring the sales, the returns, the support calls, online metrics, live reviews, and some telemetry or in-product metrics like, uh, bugs and how people are constantly using that. And so, that's how I would address solving, um, the designing a fridge for kids question. Awesome. Um, well, uh, applause to you, Diego. That was a really awesome interview answer. I wanna take a moment to pop out of the interview and just talk a little bit about how it was for you. Um, we already kind of talked about the interview throughout the process, but I'm curious to hear if you had any other tips or things you wanted to share with viewers, um, including maybe also a little bit more about where to find more resources by you too. Yeah, absolutely. Uh, I think, um, o- one of the, some of the biggest mistakes that, that, uh, candidates do during these, uh, interviews is that, like I said at the beginning, they, they go through a framework end to end thinking that that's the end of the interview without making it a dialog, and so solving products in an interview, just like in real life, it's about a dialog with the other person. The other person might be a PM, and you're gonna collaborate with them. So, the, the product question is not just about rushing through the framework. It's about solving this problem together. The interviewer is there to help you, uh, come up with, with the solutions through questions and through going deep in other different things. H- he's not just there to see if you can follow the framework, so that's one advice that I would give. And the second is, and I, I sometimes get this a, a lot before an interview is, "Hey, I have an interview tomorrow. I have not practiced at all." Practice, practice, practice. You wouldn't believe how much actually practicing will help you. Do as many mock interviews as you can. There are plenty of resources out there. Go on LinkedIn, post that, um, you're, you're looking for, uh, mock interviews, and you'll be surprised at how many people will be willing to help you with that. So practice as much as you can.
