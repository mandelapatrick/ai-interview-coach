============================================================

**Interviewer:** You   shipped   YouTube   comments   on   mobile   devices.   Comment   engagements   are   up,   but   YouTube   watch   time   is   down.   What   do   you   do?   Hey,   everyone.   Welcome   back   to   another   Exponent   Product   Management   Mock   Interview.   My   name's   Kevin   Wei,   and   on   today's   show   we   have   Cherry.   And   before   we   get   started,   could   you   just   tell   the   audience   a   little   bit   about   yourself?  
**Candidate:** Hey,   everyone.   Um,   I'm   Cherry.   Uh,   I'm   a   former   product   manager   at   Google,   and   one   of   the   products   I   worked   on   was,   uh,   YouTube   as   well   as   Google   Maps.   I'm   super   excited   to   be   doing   the   mock   interview.  
**Interviewer:** Thanks,   Cherry.   So   today   let's   do   an   analytical   or   execution-type   interview   question,   and   the   question   I   have   for   you   today   is,   you   shipped   YouTube   comments   on   mobile   devices.   Comment   engagements   are   up,   but   YouTube   watch   time   is   down.   What   do   you   do?  
**Candidate:** Awesome.   Okay,   so   just   to   clarify.   Uh,   I'm   just   gonna   repeat   it   back   to,   to   help   me.   Uh,   you   shipped   YouTube   comments   on   mobile   devices,   uh,   and   comments   engagement   are   up,   but   the   YouTube   watch   time   is   down,   and,   uh,   and   you   wanna   hear   kind   of   my   process   about   handling   this   scenario.   Is   that   right?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   that's   correct.  
**Candidate:** Great.   Um,   well,   I'll   just   kind   of   outline,   uh,   overall   how   I'd   like   to   approach   this.   Uh,   so   I   want   to   kind   of   clarify,   um,   you   know,   some   of   the   terms   in   our   question   and   set   up   the   parameters   for   our   discussion.   Uh,   I'll,   I'll   list   some   high-level   reasons   that   could   be   causing   the   problem,   um,   and   try   to   gather   context   information,   maybe   ask   you   a   few   questions   to   understand   more.   Um,   and   once   we   can   start   discarding   issues   that   are   out   of   scope,   I'll   establish   a   theory   of   probable   cause,   um,   and   then   we   can   try   to   test   this   theory   and   fix   the   problem.   Does   that   sound   good?  
**Interviewer:** Yep,   that   sounds   good.  
**Candidate:** Sweet.   Um,   so   yeah,   clarifying   and   establishing   the   situation   a   bit   further.   I   want   to   be   really   explicit   about   the   goals   of   this   launch,   right?   We   should   never   launch   a   product   or   feature   blindly   without   any   expectation   of   what's   gonna,   what's   gonna   happen,   right?   Launches   don't   go   out   into   a   black   void   and   then,   woo,   surprise,   like,   the   comments   engagement   went   up,   and,   and   this   happened.   Um,   so   in   this   particular   scenario,   before   the   launch   of   YouTube   comments,   um,   I   would   have   expected   that   me   and   my   team   have   established   some   launch   criteria   as   well   as   backstop   metrics.   Um,   I'll   go   ahead   and   take   a   quick   stab   at   sort   of   approximating   this   to   help   frame   our   decision,   uh,   for   what   to   do   after   it's   launched,   because   I   don't   think   we   can   have   a   meaningful   discussion   about   what   happened   after   launch   until   we   have   success   metrics.   So   is   it   okay   if   I   use   some   numbers   to   illustrate   what   I   mean   by   this?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   go   ahead.  
**Candidate:** Yeah,   okay.   So   let's   assume,   um,   I'm   just   pulling   a   number   here.   I   ju-   let's   just   assume   that   50%   of   all   YouTube   watch   time   happens   on   mobile   devices,   right?   And   so   the   feature   is   YouTube   comments   on   mobile.   I'll   assume   that   YouTube   comments   on   desktop   has   already   been   launched.   We   know   that   desktop   came   first,   and   so   now,   yes,   we   want   these   comments   on   mobile.   Super   exciting.   Um,   by   launching   comments   on   mobile,   we   would   definitely   expect   that   comments   engagement   to   go   up.   If   comments   engagement   at   launch   is   at   a   similar   level   to   what   we   saw   on   desktop,   then   just   by   launching,   we   should   have   essentially   doubled   comments   engagement,   right,   by   bringing   it   to   mobile.   So   it's   a   given   that   comments   engagement   goes   up.   And   let's   say   we   set   our   success   metric   to   be   that   comments   engagement   is   at   least   50%   increased.   You   know,   at   minimum,   we   have   feature   performance   parity.   Um,   on   desktop,   we   have   the   setup   where   on   YouTube,   you   know,   you   have   the   vi-   the   currently   playing   video   on   the   left,   we   have   comments   below   it,   and   then   a   column   of   recommended   videos   to   the   right   side.   Uh,   so   the   currently   playing   video,   the   comments   section,   and   the   next   recommended   videos   can   all   be   visible   on   the   screen   at   the   same   time.   Considering   some   implications   of   mobile   here,   uh,   real   estate   on   phone   is   a   lot   less   than   desktop,   so   we   won't   be   able   to   kind   of   so   neatly   fit   all   those   three   features   on   the   screen   at   one   time.   Um,   in   launching   comments   V0,   uh,   let's   say   we   made   the   decision   to,   you   know,   put   the   comments   section   on   top   of   the   recommended   videos   that   would   normally   be   below   the   video   player.   So   previously,   if   it   were   just   videos   and   more   videos,   we   now   have   videos,   comments,   more   videos,   right?   And   therefore,   it's   a   pretty   logical   assumption   that   watch   time   is   gonna   be   affected   or,   uh,   more   videos   below,   uh,   will   be   s-   less   seen,   right?   If   we're   showing   less   of   those   recommendations,   then   the   users   will   watch   less.   I   think   the   real   question   here   is,   how   much   are   we   okay   with,   right?   There   is   some   trade-off.   In   a   perfect   world,   I   think   everything   would   go   up   and,   you   know,   there's   no,   no   downside   at   all,   but   user   attention   is   a   pretty   limited   resource.   Uh,   so   if   a   user   has   10   minutes   to   spend   on   YouTube,   maybe   they   spend   seven   minutes   watching   a   video,   their   first   video,   and   then   they   spend   like   three   minutes   watching   a   follow-up   video   from   the   recommendations.   But   if   we're   inserting   comments,   maybe   you   spent   seven   minutes   on   the   first   video,   uh,   and   you   spend   three   minutes   browsing   comments,   and   then   we   lose   out   on   the   extra   three   minutes   of   watch   time   that   we   might   have   gotten,   right?   Uh,   given   those,   uh,   let's   we   as-   we,   we   assume   that,   you   know,   there's   gonna   be   some   drop   in   watch   time.   Maybe   we   set   a   backstop   metric   of   we're   okay   with   a   5%   drop   in   YouTube   watch   time,   right?   Um,   I'm,   I'm   just   saying   5%   today.   I   mean,   it   could   be   we   saw   something   similar   when   we   launched   comments   on   desktop   and   we   know   that   in   the   long   term,   rolling   out   comments   is   a   better   strategic   move.   We   have   some   strategy   that   we're   gonna   see   it   go   up   in   the   future,   that's   why   we're   okay   with   5%.   I   think   it's,   you   know,   it's   reasonable   that   we   assume   that   there'll   be   a   drop,   but   we   wanna   set   the   backstrop-   backdrop-   backstop   of   5%.   Uh,   does   that   sound   reasonable?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   I,   I   don't   think   the   exact   number   is   important   here.   I'm   kind   of   curious,   um,   w-   what   you   might   do   here.   So   l-   let's,   let's   assume,   I   think,   l-   let's   assume   that   the   current,   uh,   ordering   on   mobile   is   video,   comments,   and   then   recommended   videos.   I   think   that's   fair,   and   I'm   curious   where   you   might   go   from   here.   But   I   think   everything   you've   laid   out   so   far   definitely   makes   sense.  
**Candidate:** Awesome.   Yeah,   uh,   definitely   this   is   just   some   quick   back   of   the   napkin   sort   of   thinking   so   we   have   some   numbers   to   work   with.   I'm   not   doing   anything   crazy.   It's   like   5%   and   50%,   right?   Um,   I   want   to   get   to   the   post-launch   evaluation   part,   and   I   think   that's   where   it's   interesting.   Uh,   but   the   reason   why   I   wanted   to   take   the   time   to,   to   set   this   up   is   because   it   gives   us   a   framework,   right?   Our   launch   criteria......   is   that   comment   engagement   is   50%   increased   and   watch   time   does   not   drop   more   than   5%.   So   going   back   to   the   question,   I   shipped   YouTube   comments   on   mobile   devices.   Comments   engagement   are   up,   but   YouTube   watch   time   is   down.   What   do   I   do?   Well   then,   that   just   depends   entirely   on   the   numbers,   right?   In   one   case,   let's   say   comment   engagement   is   50%   increased,   watch   time   dropped   4%.   But   the,   the   comments   engagement   is   good,   it's,   it's   what   we   want   it   to   look   like,   then   we   launch,   right?   That's   what   we   do.   Yes,   the   watch   time   is   down,   but   we   made   that   decision   beforehand   and,   and   that's,   that's   how   you   make   a   clear   decision.   Like,   you   can't   have   something   happen   in   the   data   and   be   like,   "Well,   I   actually   don't   know   about   that,"   right?   So   I   think   if   we   establish   good   launch   criteria,   then   less   than   5%   is   okay.   Yes,   the   watch   time   is   down,   but   we're   gonna   launch.   The   second   case   could   be   comment   engagement   is   50%   increased,   right,   but   watch   time   dropped   10%.   We   don't   launch   there.   We   need   to   stop,   we   need   to   dive   into   the   data,   and   we   need   to   figure   out   where   that   extra   drop   is   coming   from.   You   know,   there   are   other   cases   too,   like   comment   engagement   only   increased   10%,   but   watch   time   dropped   20%,   20%   or   something.   Uh,   we   don't   launch,   right?   You,   you   see   what   I'm   getting   at.   But,   uh,   for   today,   like,   we'll,   we'll   focus   on   the,   the   comment   engagement   is,   like,   plus   50%   increased,   uh,   but   watch   time   dropped   over   5%.   Right?   This   is   where   we   get-   it   gets   interesting.   And   my   overarching   goal   here   is   to   identify   the   problem   causing   this,   let's   say,   10%   drop,   right?   Uh,   propose   and   execute   a   fix   so   that   the   metrics   get   to   within   our   launch   criteria,   and   then   we   can   safely   roll   out   the   feature.   Um,   cool.   So   before   I   start   breaking   it   down,   uh,   there's   one   more   thing   I   wanted   to   clarify,   which   is   this   measure   of   engagement,   right?   I   was   kinda   talking   broadly   about   the   50%,   but,   uh,   how   would   you   kind   of   like   to   define   comment   engagement?   Is   it   by   the   number   of   comments   created,   the   number   of   replies   to   comments,   the   number   of   likes   someone   would   comment,   time   spent   scrolling   on   comments,   taps   on   a   comments?   Um,   you   know,   all   of   the   above?   Uh,   just   love   to   know   if   there's   anything   in   particular   you   had   in   mind.  
**Interviewer:** Well,   so   let's   say   the   team   just   has   some   aggregate   score.   Um,   so   everything,   uh,   i-   encompasses   everything   that   you've   mentioned.  
**Candidate:** Sweet.   Okay,   cool.   And   can   I   also   assume   that   we   have   some   spam/abuse   detection   in   place?   Because,   uh,   you   know,   for   a   big   company   to   roll   out   a   open   forum   of   text,   I   think   it   is   a   risk   to   not   assume   that   we   put   some   measure   of   abuse   in   place   so   that   these   are   not   just   spam.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   Y-   you   could   assume   that,   uh,   these   are   meaningful   comments.  
**Candidate:** Okay.   Sweet.   Great.   Um,   all   right.   At   a   very   high   level,   the   decline   in   watch   time   is   due   to,   one,   users   watching   less   minutes   of   YouTube   videos,   right?   Um,   and   we   also   know   that   users   are   creating,   replying,   liking,   and   sharing   more   comments   on   YouTube.   Uh,   so   to   start   the   diagnosing   the   cause   of   these   behaviors,   I'll   begin   by   asking   the   following   questions   to   get   some   more   context   around,   uh,   the   decline   in   relation   to   the   launch   of   comments.   Uh,   so   first   of   all,   let's   just   kind   of   think   about   the   time   period,   right?   Is   this   decline   in   watch   time   a   one-time   event,   um,   or   has   it   happened   sort   of   progressively?   Uh,   essentially,   what   does   that   graph   look   like,   right,   uh,   of   YouTube   watch   time?   If   it's   a   one-time   thing,   then   it's   a   possibility   that   a   technology   glitch   caused   this   problem,   such   as   a   downtime   in   the   services   that   support   YouTube.   You   know,   this   has   happened   before.   Um,   or   is   it   a   big   drop   of   watch   time   on   day   one   of   the   launch   when   everyone   saw   the   new   comments   feature   and   just   went   absolutely   crazy   for   it?   Uh,   but   now   it's   recovering   slowly,   so   maybe   our   seven-day   rolling   average   looks   a   little   shaky,   but   we   know   that   it's   gonna   go   back   up.   Um,   I   would   definitely   ask   if   there   are   any   technical   problems   that   coincided.   10%   is   a   big   drop.   You   know,   check   to   make   sure   that   the   watch   time   looks   healthy   in   the   control   group   as   well.   Um,   you   know,   if   the   decline   in   engagement   is   progressive   and   the   cause   is   still   there,   then   we   continue   diving   deeper   into   data.   All   right.   Another   thing,   just   at   a   higher   level   to   think   about,   is   the   region.   Um,   is   the   decline   in   YouTube   watch-   uh,   watch   time   happening   in   a   isolated   region?   You   know,   if   this   is   true,   like,   the   problem   might   be   specific   to   a   country   and   it   could   be   an   issue   with   interna-   internash-   Oh,   this   word   kills   me.   Internationalization,   um,   or   localization,   right?   So   YouTube   comments,   they   show   text   strings   in   rows.   Um,   but   each   language   has   different   types   of   text.   I'm   just   kind   of   ideating   here   on   what   could   be   the   cause   for   some   of   these   different   countries   having   different   results.   Um,   for   instance,   Chinese   characters,   very   compact,   right?   The   same   sentence,   uh,   could   be   one   line   in   Chinese,   but   take   up   five   lines   in   German,   which   is   a   super   long   language.   Uh,   did   that   impact   how   long   our   comment   section   sort   of   expanded   to,   uh,   and   therefore   potentially   affect   the   amount   of   scrolling   that   users   have   to   do   in   one   region   to   get   to   the   recommended   videos   below   or,   um,   or   somehow   impact,   you   know,   what   they're   seeing   on   their   screens?   So,   region   is   one   thing   we   could   consider.   Another   thing   is   thinking   about   platforms.   Um,   is   the   decline   happening   on   a   specific   platform,   such   as   iOS   or   Android?   If   so,   I   would   definitely   compare   the   drop   of   YouTube   watch   time   engagement   on   each   platform   with   engagement   across   all   platforms,   right?   Does   something   about   our   new   feature,   the   way   that   we   built   it,   not   work   as   well   considering   unique   UI   patterns   of   different   platforms?   You   know,   uh,   we   know   that   people   swipe   on   iOS   versus   they   use   a   back   button   on   Android.   Did   we   properly   accommodate   for   tap   target   sizes,   um,   across   different   screens?   Uh,   could   users   be   accidentally   tapping   comments   and   therefore   driving   our   engagement   up,   uh,   when   they   actually   want   something   else?   Right.   So   these   are   all   things   that   I   want   to   have   logging   for,   um,   have   our   engineers   dive   deeper   into-   to   answering   these   questions,   right?   And   of   course,   you   know,   thinking   holistically,   is   this   decline   in   engagement   happening   in   other   YouTube   features   besides   watch   time?   So   for   instance,   are   YouTube   searches   down?   Are   users   overall   spending   less   time   on   YouTube?   You   know,   if   so,   we-   we've   definitely   got   a   much   bigger   problem.   It's   not   just   YouTube   watch   time   that's   down.   We've   somehow   affected   the   whole   system   and,   and   we   need   to   look   at   that   as   well.So   I've   just   kind   of   laid   that   out.   Uh,   to   be   fair,   it's   probably   not   gonna   be   the   case   that   all   of   the   above   are   happening   simultaneous.   That'd   be   a   (laughs)   pretty   disastrous   launch.   Um,   so   this   series   of   questions,   for   me,   kind   of   helps   me   fine-tune   where   that   problem   is,   is   really   coming   from.   And,   you   know,   uh,   I   think   in   a   real   world   setting,   we,   we   do   the   due   diligence   and   we'd   get   answers.   Um,   I   want   to   be   exhaustive   when   it   comes   to   listing,   you   know,   all   these   possible   causes   because,   you   know,   then   we   can   establish   the   theory   of   probable   cause.   Um,   yeah.   So   to,   to   continue   with   more   in-depth   analysis,   should   we   assume   that,   you   know,   it's,   it's   not   like   a   regional   problem   or   it's   not   platform-specific?   Um,   maybe   it's   just,   like,   a   more   progressive   decline,   um,   and,   and   therefore,   like,   we   wanna   dive   deeper?  
**Interviewer:** So   you've   mentioned   a   few   interesting   things   about   you've   looked   into   drastic   versus   steady   declines,   tech   glitches,   region,   or,   uh,   platform,   or   anything   wrong   with   the   ecosystem   on   YouTube.   L-   let's   say   that   yes,   i-   it   seems   like   this   is   a   s-   a   steady   decline.   So   I'm   kind   of   curious   where   you   might   go   from   here.  
**Candidate:** Right.   Yeah.   So   we'll,   we'll,   we'll,   we'll   rule   out,   let's   say   we   checked   all   the   countries,   looks   like   it's   declining   in   all   the   countries,   um,   and,   uh,   it,   the   situation   is   generally   not   due   to   some   tech   glitch,   right?   Um,   so   yeah,   then,   um,   I   want   to   continue   diagnosing   what   could   cause   users   to   behave   in   the   two   ways   I   described,   right?   Which   is   one,   they're   creating,   replying,   liking   more   cont-   uh,   comments,   so   the   aggregate   score   is   going   up,   um,   but   two,   watching   less   video.   Uh,   so   concerning   the   reduced   watch   time,   um,   the   most   important   question   for   me,   um,   regarding   watch   time   specifically   is,   like,   where   is   that   reduction   of   watch   time   coming   from?   Uh,   is   the   10%   loss   primarily   coming   from   less   engagement   with   the   recommended   videos   that   would   have   normally   shown   up,   um,   above   the   comments,   right?   If   so,   then   I   think   there's   a,   a   bunch   of,   like,   low-hanging   fruit   that   we   can   try   out,   right?   We   can   consider   some   treatments   to,   um,   reduce   the   size,   show   less   comments,   and   more   recommended,   more   recommendations.   Um,   if   at   launch   maybe   we   did   three   comments,   um,   and   then   a   expansion   in   the   recommended   videos,   we   could   try   showing   just   two   or   just   one   comment   to   save   space   to   push   up   the   recommendations.   Um,   this   could   be   something   we   just   run   quickly   to   see   if   indeed   we,   we   start   to   reduce   the   impact   on   watch   time.   Like,   it   doesn't   have   to   be   the   final   solution.   I   think   these   are   things   that   we   can   test.   Um,   if   users   were   also,   like,   previously   watching   an   average   of   three   recommendations   after   their   first   video,   what,   what's   that   changed?   Has   that   changed?   Are   they,   like,   now   watching   zero   new   videos   after   their   first   video?   Um,   I   mentioned   earlier   that,   you   know,   users   have   limited   atten-   time   and   attention.   If   now   we're   only   showing   one   re-   new   recommendation   above   the   fold,   so   above   the   point   where   the   user   needs   to   scroll   down,   um,   and   maybe   that   first   video   is,   like,   15   minutes   long,   um,   maybe   yeah,   I,   I   wouldn't   want   to   click   on   that   after   spending   so   much   time   playing   with   these   new   comments,   right?   So   perhaps   we   can   consider   a   treatment   where   we   adjust   the   ranking   for   the   new   recommendations   to   be   shorter   videos   up   top   so   that   we   can   kind   of,   you   know,   make   it,   make   the   barrier   to   clicking   another   video   lower.   Um,   so   I   think   there's   a   lot   of   things   we   can   play   with   here   in   the   category   of   how   do   we   make   the,   the   portion   of   videos   below   the,   the   currently   playing   videos,   so   that   all   those   recommendations,   how   can   we   make   that   more   appealing?   How   can   we   up   the,   uh,   the   engagement   with   them?   Because   that,   we're   seeing   that   there's   a   lot   of   reduction   of   watch   time   there,   right?   Um,   there's   another   thing   I   think   that's   worth   bringing   up.   Like,   is   it   an   education   problem?   Like,   do   users   not   know   you   can   scroll   down   to   see   more,   um,   more   recommendations?   Like   previously   they're   used   to   seeing   their   recommendations   right   below   the   video,   but   we've   put   comments   and   then   maybe   there's   this   assumption   like,   "Oh,   it's   just   the   comments   and   that's   the   end."   Um,   so   a   potential   solution   here   I   think   is,   like,   trying   to   add   a   tool   tip   or   some   education,   educational   banner   of   like,   "By   the   way,   like,   we   added   comments,   but   you   can   still   scroll   down   to   see   all   the   recommendations   that   you   know   and   love."   Right?   So   I   think   that's,   that's   the,   for   me,   if   we   answer   the   question   of,   like,   the   reduc-   reduction   of   watch   time   is   coming   entirely   from   users   clicking   less   recommendations,   um,   below   the   fold,   like,   let's   try   a   couple   of   these   UI   treatments,   let's   see   how   users   respond,   and   then   see   if   we   can   start   to   recover   some   of   that,   um,   that   10%   loss   and   get   it   closer   to   the   5%   range,   right?   The   other   thing,   if   we   go   on   a   deeper   level,   is   there   a   problem,   um,   with   the   recommendation   video   pipeline,   uh,   the   type   of   video   content   being   shown?   Um,   are   recommendations   being   generated   but   not   displayed   on   the   screen?   You   know,   if   this   were   the   case,   it   could   explain   why,   you   know,   users   are   not   watching   as   much   Uh,   I   mean,   I,   I   get   that   this,   this   is   a,   one   of   those   cases   where   we   probably   see   a   drastic   decline   as   opposed   to   a   progressive   decline.   If   we   somehow   (laughs)   wiped   the   recommendations   from   the   screen   entirely,   then,   um,   we'd   probably   see   a   cliff   in   terms   of   the,   the   engagement.   So   the   probability   of   this   being   the   cause   is,   is   small.   Um,   but   yeah,   I   think,   you   know,   just   keeping   a,   a   very   tight   eye   on   what's   happening,   everything,   uh,   everything   that's   happening   within   the,   uh,   the   YouTube   recommendations   below   the   current   video,   um,   let's,   we   can   think   about   whether   there's   been   an   increase   in   video   reports   or,   or   user   dissatisfaction   on   recommended   videos.   You   know,   poor   recommendations   could   cause   users   to   leave   the   app   and   be   a   possible   cause   of   this   progressive   decline   in   engagement.   I'd   definitely   investigate   this   further.   Um,   and   ask   my   engineering   team   to   check   whether   the,   there   are   any   changes   or   signs   that   the   algorithm   is   performing   abnormally,   um,   or   even,   you   know,   the   results   of   a   targeted   attack   where   hackers   try   to   drive   up   malicious   content   in   the   speed,   right?   We   know   that's   happened   where   people   will   just   do   that   and,   and   all   of   a   sudden   you're,   you're   seeing   this   kind   of   bad   content   being   pushed   to   the   top   of   your   recommendations.   Um,   so   I   think   those   are,   like,   if   we,   if   we   kind   of   pinpoint,   like,   A,   we,   we   have   this   new   UI   where   instead   of   seeing   my   module   of   recommended   videos   right   below   my   current   video,   it's   been   pushed   lower.   Like,   there's   a   couple   things   I   think   we   can   try   in   terms   of   making   that   more   prominent,   um,   making   that   first   tap   into,   uh,   the,   the   recommendations   a   little   bit   more   appealing   by   having   a   shorter   video,   um,   diving   deeper   to   make   sure   that   there's   nothing   wrong   in   the   pipeline   overallUm,   and,   you   know,   I,   I   also   want   to,   I   think,   do   some   due   diligence   and   even   though   we   see   overall   that   comments   is   up   50%   and   we   have   some   aggregate   score   that   is   taking   into   account   abuse.   Um,   yeah,   like,   let's   just   make   sure   that   this   new   increase   in   comments   is   primarily   positive   engagement,   and   that   we   can   be   sure   that   it   is   the   users   that   would   have   been   watching   more   video,   um,   that   are   commenting,   right?   So   we're   making   sure   that   it's   a   one-to-one.   So   those   users   that   would   have   been   tapping   on   more   videos,   they're   the   ones   commenting   and   it's   not   some   mismatch   here   where   we're   assuming   that   that's   the   case   when   maybe   it's   not,   right?   Um,   so   yeah.   I   mean,   uh,   I   know   we're,   we're   roughly   at   time   but   to,   to   summarize   my   approach   to   kind   of   finding   this,   this   lower   watch   time,   and   we   can   go   deeper,   is   just,   you   know,   understanding   that   context,   um,   being   sure   to,   that   we   can   hone   in   on   the   real   problem   to   solve   and   discard   the   things   that   are   unrelated,   um,   and,   and   just   continue   to   test   each   of   these   probable   causes   to   identify   the   exact   source.   Um,   and   you   know,   if   we   do   find   that,   that   thing   that   helps   us   lift   the,   uh,   the   decline   to   the   right   level,   um,   then   I   think   we   can   safely   launch   the   feature.  
**Interviewer:** Thanks,   Cherry.   And   before   we   do   end   the   mock,   I   do   have   one   follow-up   question.   And   you,   you,   you,   you   mentioned   some   interesting   A/B   tests,   like   reducing   the   size   of   the   comments   or   changing   the   sort   of   videos   that   are   recommended.   Uh,   how   would   you   go   about   testing   one   of   these,   uh,   experiments?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   So,   um,   one,   one   example   I   brought   up   was,   like,   let's   say   at   launch   we   did   three   comments,   right?   Um,   I   think   a   set-up   for   a   s-   uh,   an   experiment   like   this,   we   just   have   multiple   arms.   Uh,   you   always   have   a   control   and   then,   um,   you   would   have,   you   know,   an   arm   perhaps   with   three   comments,   and   then   an   arm   with   two   comments,   and   then   an   arm   with   one   comment.   And   we'd   compare   what   the   decline   of   watch   time   looks   across   all   of   those   four   arms   that   I   just   said   up,   right?   So   the,   the   variable   that   we're   testing   is   the   number   of   comments   that   we   show.   How   does   that   impact,   um,   decline   on   watch   time?   So   we   know   that   with   our   control,   there   should   be   no   impact   on   watch   time,   and   we   know   that   with   three   comments,   which   was   our   init-   initial   launch,   um,   that   caused   a   10%   decline.   So   do,   does   putting   only   two   comments   reduce   that   to   maybe,   like,   7%,   and   one   comment   is   only   5%?   Um,   that's   kind   of   the   measure   that   I   would   be   checking.   Uh,   we   wanna   keep   that   experiment   pretty   clean   and   only   test   one   thing.   Like,   um,   another   A/B   could   be,   like,   we   wanna   put   a   new   tool   tip   that   says,   "By   the   way,   more   recommendations   below."   We   have   a   control,   no   tool   tip,   um,   and,   uh,   a   test   arm   where   we   put   the   tool   tip   and   just   kind   of   compare   the   engagement   and   the,   the   impact   on   the   watch   time.  
**Interviewer:** And   so   how   would   you   choose   whether   you   want   to   choose   the,   uh,   the,   which,   which,   uh,   testing   arm,   uh,   that   performed   better?   Um,   so   l-   l-   let's   say,   like,   like,   the   two   comments   was   a   5%   decline   and   then   the   one   comment   was   a   2%   decline.   Which   one   would   you   choose?  
**Candidate:** Uh,   we'd   definitely   choose   the,   the   arm   that's   best.   I   mean,   if,   if   we   can,   it,   it,   it   also,   I   think,   depends   on   the,   uh,   the   comments   engagement.   If   comments   engagement   is   the   same   for   both,   then   let's   choose   the   arm   with   less,   uh,   watch   time   decline,   right?   But   I   think,   like,   where   it   gets   a   bit   trickier   is,   like,   let's   say,   oh,   we   only   decreased   watch   time   by   2%   but   our   comment   engagement   is   now   only   40%,   right?   Then   we   go   back   to,   what   is   our   launch   criteria,   right?   We   established   that   way   from   the   beginning,   um,   and   that's   what   we   need   to   launch   this.   We,   I   think,   w-   the   reason   it's   so   important   to   have   that,   um,   always   at   the   back   of   our   minds   is   because   we,   that,   therefore   we   don't   see   some   data   from   a   result,   uh,   experiment   result   and   be   like,   "Well,   this   kinda   seems   bad   or   this   kinda   seems   better."   Um,   we   always   have,   um,   what   we   decided   at   the   beginning   to   guide   us.   And   we   know   that,   you   know,   40%   comment   engagement   is   not   what   we're   looking   for,   so   even   though   it   only   impacted,   um,   the   watch   time   by   2%,   I   don't   feel   comfortable   launching   until   we   can   get   the,   the,   get   us   back   to   the   50%.  
**Interviewer:** Great.   Well,   thanks,   Cherry,   for   the   excellent   mock   interview.   Um,   I   honestly   don't   have   much   feedback   to   give.   This   was   a   very   structured   and   thorough   answer   that   you   gave.   I'm   wondering   if   you   might   have   any   self-feedback   that   you   wanted   to   share?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   I   mean,   I   think   it   is   interesting   to   consider   the   implications,   uh,   for   specifically   this   question   with,   um,   abuse.   Uh,   I   know   that   we   kind   of   decided   that   we   were   just   gonna   assume   that   we   have   some   abuse   system,   but   I   do   think,   um,   it   is   important   to   consider,   um,   in   real   product,   uh,   environments,   as   well   as   in   interviews,   uh,   the   fact   that   any   time   you   have   users,   uh,   writing   comments,   any   time   you   have   a   freeform   text   box,   that   is   a   fire   hose   of   abuse.   And   more   often   than   not,   um,   I   think   growth   can   translate   to   actually   just   growth   of   abuse   and   growth   of   bad   content.   Um,   so   I   do   think   that   when   we   think   about   things   like,   oh,   engagement   has   gone   up   a   ton,   um,   abuse   is   definitely   a   big   thing   that,   um,   should   be   a   part   of   the   question   for   any   media   site.   Um,   but   yeah.   I,   I   didn't   obviously   want   to,   uh,   have   our   entire   interview   today   be   about   abuse,   so   I   think   if   one   thing   I   would've   loved   to   go   in   a   little   deeper   is,   is   kind   of   my   approach   to   handling   that.  
**Interviewer:** Got   it.   Cool.   Well,   thanks   again   for   being   on   today's   show.   This   was   a   great   mock   interview.   And   for   the   viewers,   if   you   have   a   different   approach   on   how   you'd   answer   this,   please   leave   a   note   in   the   comments.
