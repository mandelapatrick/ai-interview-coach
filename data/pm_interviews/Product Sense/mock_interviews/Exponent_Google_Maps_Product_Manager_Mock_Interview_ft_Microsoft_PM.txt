============================================================

**Interviewer:** ...   design   a   new   feature   to   improve   Google   Maps.   (instrumental music)   Hey,   everyone.   I'm   Kevin   Wei.   I   am   a   product   manager   on   IBM's   data   and   AI   team,   and   today   we're   doing   a   mock   product   management   interview   question   with   Nathan.   Nathan,   do   you   mind   saying   a   few   words   to   introduce   yourself   to   the   audience?  
**Candidate:** Sure.   Hey,   everyone.   My   name's   Nathan.   I   am   currently   a   product   manager   at   Microsoft   Mixed   Reality,   and   excited   to   do   this   mock.  
**Interviewer:** Awesome,   Nathan.   So   for   today's   question,   I'd   like   to   ask   you   to   design   a   new   feature   to   improve   Google   Maps.  
**Candidate:** Great.   Awesome.   So   just   to   follow   up   on   that,   should   the   goal   of   improving   Google   Maps   be   around   anything   specific   like   engagement   or   revenue   or   impact?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   that's   totally   up   to   you   for   what   the   goal   should   be.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   great.   I   think   let's   focus   on   engagement.   I   think...   So   that   will   tag   along   a   lot   of   other   opportunities   for   revenue   and   impact,   so   let's   start   there.   So   to   recap,   our   goal   will   be   to   how   can   I   design   a   feature   to   increase   engagement   for   users   using   Google   Maps?   Um,   so   to   start   I'm   gonna   take   a   bit   of   time   to   think   through   the   different   types   of   users   who   use   Google   Maps   and   then   brainstorm   a   few   of   their   pain   points   and   try   to   see   if   we   can   identify   which   segment   might   make,   make   the   most   sense   to   tackle.  
**Interviewer:** Sounds   good.   And   do   you   plan   to   design   for   an   app   or   for   desktop?  
**Candidate:** Great   question.   Um,   I   think   this   will   likely   be   a   mobile   experience   to   start,   um,   and   then   we   can   potentially   touch   on   what   a   desktop   companion   might   look   like.   But   I...   given   my   assumption   is   that   most   users   are   using   M-   Google   Maps   on   a   mobile   platform,   and   I   think   that   would   make   the   most   sense.  
**Interviewer:** Great.   Yeah.   Thanks   for   laying   that   out.  
**Candidate:** Okay,   so   I   think   the...   when   I   think   of   who   uses   Google   Maps,   the   first   few   user   groups   that   come   to   mind   are   those   who   are,   say,   like   professional   workers,   like   a   Uber   or   Lyft   driver   or   a   delivery   driver,   someone   who   needs   to   navigate   very   frequently   to   different   l-   locations.   Um,   so   that's   one   category.   The   other   category   of   users   I   think   are   just   maybe   someone   like   myself   looking   for   directions   to   go   to   a   new   gym   or   a   new   restaurant,   somewhere   local.   And   I   think   the   third   category   of   users   I   thought   of   was   a   group   of   people   or   someone   going   to   somewhere   a   bit   further   away   for   a   trip.   So   I'm   thinking   if   I   wanna   spend   a   weekend   out   at   somewhere,   I'm   probably   gonna   use   Google   Maps   to   see   how   far   it's   gonna   take   to   get   there,   where   I   might   stop   and   gas   along   the   way,   et   cetera.   So   between   these   three   groups,   I   just   thought   of   very   s-   top   mind   pain   points.   So   for   the   professionals,   um,   my   assumption   is   that   their   main   pain   point   is   going   to   be   looking   at   what   are   the   shortest   routes,   um,   you   know,   how   can   I   get   to   these   various   destinations   in   the   quickest   manner   and   maybe   in   a   (clears throat)   shortest   manner   to   conserve   gas?   Um,   so   that's   interesting.   For   the   users   going   somewhere   local,   I   think   potentially   a   pain   point   would   just   be,   um,   like   i-   finding   where   to   go.   So   maybe   this   could   be   a   place   where   not   only   do   they   find   a   dir-   direct-   directions   to   a   destination   but   it   could   also...   they   could   go   to   see   where   that   destination   is.   And   so   that's   interesting,   but   I   think   the   third   one   actually   encompasses   that   exact   same   pain   point   of   the   local,   but   a   lot   more.   So   I   think   there's   a   lot   more   involved   with   planning   a   larger   trip   such   as,   you   know,   where   do   I   wanna   go?   Where   am   I   gonna   stay?   Where   am   I   gonna   get   gas?   Where   am   I   going   to   eat?   And   it   just   seems   like   there's   the   most   effort   involved   with   this   type   of   user   using   Maps,   and   I   think   this   ties   nicely   with   Google's   mission,   which   is   basically   to   organize   information   and   make   it   more   useful.   And   I   think   there's   a   lot   of   information   that   Google   can...   already   has   with,   I   know,   like   their   Explore   tab,   and   that   could   maybe   make   this   experience   better   for   someone   planning   a   trip.   So   does   that   sound   good   to   you?  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   that   sounds   good.   Let's,   let's   now   dive   into   this.  
**Candidate:** Great.   Awesome.   So   let   me   reframe   where   we're   at   right   now.   So   the   objective   here   now   is   to   design   a   feature   for   users   going   on   a   trip   to   increase   engagement   with   Google   Maps.  
**Interviewer:** Okay,   sort   of   like   vacationers?  
**Candidate:** Exactly,   vacationers.  
**Interviewer:** Or   people   who   are   road   tripping.   Okay.  
**Candidate:** Yes,   perfectly.   Vacationers   is   the   word   that   I   will   use.   Awesome.   So   I'm   gonna   take   a   few   moments   to   just   think   about   what   the   potential   features   might   look   like   and   what   the   user   experience   will   be.   (clears throat)   Okay,   so   from   a   high   level   what   I'm   thinking   about   here   is   designing   a   new   feature   called,   like,   Trips.   So   I'm   thinking   a   new   tab   within   the   mobile   UX   where   it   might   be   right   next   to   the   Explore   icon,   and   you   click   this   Trips   tab   and   I'm   thinking   this   is   a   one-stop   shop   for   someone   to   (clears throat)   plan   everything   about   their   trip.   And   so   I've   broken   this   down   into   three   buckets.   So   I'm   thinking   first   of   all   would   just   be,   like,   high   level,   high   level   aspects   of   the   trip.   So   when   would   you   go?   Is   this,   like,   a   multi-day   trip?   Is   it   over   a   weekend?   What   are   the   dates?   Where   a   user   might   go.   So   is   it   to,   you   know,   a   new   national   park?   Somewhere   closer?   Somewhere   further   away?   And   the   second   bucket   would   be   specifics,   so,   you   know,   what   specific   activities   a   user   might   do.   Um,   are   they   gonna   go   hiking?   Are   they   gonna   go   swimming?   Um,   are   they   gonna   go   rock   climbing?   What-   whatever   it   might   be.   And   then   where   are   they   gonna   stay,   which   hotel   they   might   be   in,   um,   which   Airbnb   might   be   in,   there   might   be   potential   for   integration   there.   Um,   and   where   to   get   gas,   where   to   eat,   et   cetera.   And   then   the   third   bucket   is   just   kind   of   miscellaneous   items   such   as,   like,   downloading   offline   maps.   Um,   I   know   that's   already   a   feature,   but   I   think   we   can   further   optimize   that   (clears throat) ....   given   a   little   bit   more   information.   So   just   so   to   take   this   one   higher   level,   what   I'm   thinking   is   Google   Maps   currently   is   used   where   a   user   is   just   actively   determining   where   they   wanna   go.   So   I'm   already...   I,   I   should   already   know   where   I   want   to   go   before   kind   of   typing   that   into   Google   Maps.   But   they   also   have   a   function   called   Explore,   which   is   where   a   user   might   not   know   exactly   what   they're   going   to   do,   but   they   just   know   that   they   wanna   do   something,   right?   And   so   I'm   thinking   of   combining   the   two   aspects   here   to   see   if   we   can   plan   an   overall   itinerary   using   Google's   data   to   basically   curate   and   automate   the   process   of   designing   an   itinerary   for   a   trip   that   makes   this   as   easy   and   efficient   as   possible.   So   does   that   sound   good   so   far?  
**Interviewer:** Can   you   give   me   an   example?   So   maybe   let's   say   I,   I'm   in   LA   and   I   wanna   go   to   Vegas,   what   would   the   end-to-end   experience   look   like?  
**Candidate:** Great.   Perfect.   So   that's   where   I'd   like   to   go.   Um,   so   let's   just   say   exactly,   you're   currently   in   LA   and   you're   planning   a   trip   to   Vegas.   So   you   already   know   where   you   wanna   go.   So   I'm   imagining   you   click   on   this   Trip   tabs,   there's   a   button   that   says   Create   New   Trip.   You   click   it,   Create   New   Trip   tab,   and   then   you   are   able   to   enter   potentially   what   you   already   know.   And   then   Google   will   fill   in...   this   feature   rather,   will   fill   in   the   rest   of   it   for   you.   So   you   already   know   you   want   to   go   to   Vegas.   So   there's   like   going   to   be   in   the   high-level   bucket   I   first   talked   about,   the   when   and   the   where,   you'll   fill   out   Las   Vegas   as   the   where   because   you   already   know   you   want   to   go   there.   And   say,   if   you   already   know   when   you   want   to   go   as   well,   you   can   input   that   information   yourself.   Um,   but   if   you   just   know   you   want   to   go   to   Vegas   but   you   don't   know   when,   this   feature   could   potentially   pull   information   from   your   calendar,   um,   just,   you   know,   best   time   to   visit   based   off   of   Google   reviews   on   maps   that   already   exist,   and   it   could   suggest   some   times,   say,   based   on   your   calendar   availability,   perhaps   a   weekend   trip   here   or   a   longer   trip   during   this,   you   know,   Thanksgiving   break   or   something   like   that,   and   it   could   also   suggest   the   best   time   to   visit.   So   if   you're   looking   to   go   to   Vegas   for   sightseeing,   I,   I   imagine   you're   going   there   for   the   casinos,   um,   but   whatever   it   might   be,   I'm   assuming   there's   like   seasonal   hotspots,   um,   if   it's   not   Las   Vegas,   it's   a   more   nature,   it's   a,   you   know,   place   you   wanna   go   hiking,   potentially   better   seasons   are   better   and   Google   could   suggest   that   as   well.   And   so   if   you   know...   just   to   recap   that,   if   you   know   where   and   when   you   want   to   go,   you   can   add   that   yourself,   but   if   you   don't,   I'm   thinking   there's   a   recommendation   engine   feature   based   off   of   data   from   your   personal   information   and   other   features   of   Google,   such   as   Calendar,   and   also   just   aggregate   user   information   about   when   the   best   times   might   be   and   where   the   best   places   might   go   that   are   around   you  
**Interviewer:** And   would   it   give   me   suggestions   for   where   to   get   gas   or   where   to   get   food   or   rest   stops?  
**Candidate:** Yep.   So   that   goes   into   the   second   category   of   specifics.   So   once   we   have   the   high-level   kind   of   when,   where   set   in   stone,   then   we   can   also   start   to   plan   out   the   specifics.   And   so   it   would   be   exactly   like   that.   So   now   we   know,   say   we   wanna   go   on   a   weekend   trip   to   Vegas,   right?   (clears throat)   First   of   all,   the,   the   Google   Maps,   this,   this   Trip   tab   will   plan   out   what   the   commute   will   look   like   from   your   current   point   of   destination   to   Las   Vegas,   right?   And   I   would   imagine   at   this   point   is   where   we   need   to   be   a   bit   more   specific   in   terms   of   where   specifically   am   I   leaving   from?   Where   specifically   will   I   be   arriving   at?   Whether   that's   first   at   a   casino   or   a   hotel.   And   there   should   be   a   number   of   recommendations   of   each   of   those   buckets.   And   I   think   if   I   can   visually   draw   this   out,   we   need   some   iterations,   but   the   simplest   version   would   be   in   the   Specifics   tab,   there's   a   few   subtabs   of   Where   to   Stay,   What   to   Eat,   Where   to   Get   Gas.   And   then   those   can   be   kind   of   clicked   on   and   dragged   and   dropped   into   this   itinerary   where   you   might   be   able   to   see   like   a   schedule-based   item,   and   that   could   break   out   into   navigation,   right?   So   I   imagine   the   first   step   a   user   will   think   about   is   where   they   want   to   stay.   So   we   could   pull   up   a   number   of   hotels   in   the   area   based   off   of   reviews,   and   this   could   be   also   a   potential   point   of   revenue   generation   where   sponsored   hotels   or   even   partnerships   with   Airbnb   per   se   could   have   listings   promoted   in   this,   in   this   top   here.   The   same   goes   for   restaurants   and   gas.   So   once   you   know   where   to   stay,   you   could   think   about   what   to   eat,   it   could   give   you   that   same   recommendations.   Um,   if   you   know   what   type   of   genre   of   food   you   want,   you   can   tap   into   that,   indicate   which   type   of   restaurant   you   want,   and   then   use...   basically   leverage   a   lot   of   the   existing   feature   work   that   is   already   existing   in   the   Google   Explore   tab   to   help   suggest,   um,   which   items   to   do.   And   so   does   that   kind   of   make   sense?   So   high   level   first   and   then   the   users   will   think   about   which   specifics   to   slot   in   for   their   itinerary  
**Interviewer:** Yeah.   When   in   the   trip   planning,   uh,   I   guess   journey   does   the   user   use   this   feature?   Is   this   like   the   day   of   when   they're   leaving   to   Vegas   or   is   this   like   a   week   before   when   they're   planning?  
**Candidate:** Okay.   That's,   that's   great.   Um,   so   this,   I   imagine   is   something   both,   right?   So   there's   the   initial   planning   stage,   which   is   kind   of   what   I'm   talking   through   now,   which   is   before   they   go,   before   they   even   know   where   they   wanna   go,   they're   using   this   to   plan   out   their   entire   experience,   right?   And   so   I   wish   I'd   broken   this   up,   but   this   would   be   the   bucket   one   that   we're   walking   through.   And   then   there   would   also   be   obviously   during   the   trip,   which   is   what   will   leverage   most   of   the   Google   Maps   type   of   interface,   um,   while   they're   driving   to   the   trip   and   it   will   kind   of   be   a   streamlined   version   of   instead   of   having   to   type   in,   "Where   am   I   going   next?   I   just   finished   this,   like,   activity   at   this   casino,   I   need   to   navigate   now   to   the   restaurant."   It   will   already   kind   of   have   that   planned   in   for   you,   and   if   you're   someone   who's   a   bit   more   spontaneous,   it   could   just   be   the   list   of   options   already   preset   there.   And   so   you   don't   need   to,   you   know,   "I'm   gonna   leave   at   1:00   PM   to   go   eat."   It   could   be   whenever   you're   done,   here   are   the   next   list   of   activities   you   have   already   brainstormed   that   you   want   to   do   next   in   your   trip.
**Interviewer:** Cool.   Yeah,   this   sounds   pretty   interesting.   So   you   said   that   you   wanted   this   to   be   a,   a   separate   tab   on   the   Google   Maps   app.   So   this   is   a   primine-   pretty   prominent   placement   that,   um,   we're   gonna   roll   out   to   our   users.   So   let's   say   I'm   the   GM   at   Maps   and   I,   I'm   saying   like,   "Hey   Nathan,   um,   this   is   awesome   but   since   we're   having   a   really   prominent   placement   for   this,   I   want   to   know   what   your   rollout   plan   is   going   to   be."  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   That,   that's   a   great   follow-up   question.   I   think,   uh,   definitely   this   feature   would   need   validation.   I   think   it's   a   very   ambitious   plan   that,   you   know,   tries   to   upgrade   Google.   Well,   not   really   upgrade,   but   it's   a   feature   that   strives   to   compete   against   say,   like   Yelp,   maybe   even   Airbnb,   and   a   lot   of   different   competitors.   And   so   it's   a   very   interesting   opportunity   space,   but   in   terms   of   rollout   and   validation,   I   would   like   to   start   with   just   like   a   standard   type   of   AB   test.   And   maybe   not   even   an   AB   test,   but   more   of   like   a,   a   focus   group.   So   just   roll   it   out   to   a   subs-   a   small   subset   of   users   just   to   see   if   there's   preliminary   feedback   that   we   can   get.   And   so   there's   two   types   of,   um,   studies   I   would   do.   One   is   just   discoverability.   So   roll   this   feature   out   to   a   small   percentage   of   Google   Maps   users   and   track   metrics   such   as   how   many   trips   are   created,   is   that   trips   tab   even   clicked   on,   just   to   see   if   people   are   interested   in   this   feature   and   to   see   what   that   looks   like.   I   think   the   other   study   I   would   like   to   run   in   parallel   is   a   dedicated   focus   group.   So   proactively   communicating   out   to   a   group   of   users   that   might   sign   up   for   beta   features   and   explain   the,   to   them   what   this   feature   does   from   a   high   level   and   have   them   purposefully   use   it   to   provide   feedback.   And   at   the   same   time,   since   we   know   that   we   will   have   these   groups   of   users   using   it,   we   can   then   track   all   secondary   metrics   such   as,   you   know,   would   partners   be   interested   in   star   level   promotions,   um,   for,   um,   spons-   not...   Yeah.   I'm   just   saying,   like   could   they   place   advertisements   on   this   trips   tab   and   to   see   if   there's   potential   for   revenue   generation   there.   But   that,   I   assume,   would   come   with   networking   effects   as   we   r-   increase   us-   users.   So   the   primary   metric   would   just   be   user   satisfaction   from   that   focus   group   to   see   if   they   like   this   feature   and   it's   something   they   would   use,   and   then   discoverability   to   see   if   users,   you   know,   just   by   default   without   any   prompt,   would   begin   to   use   this   and   then   just   see   what   that   looks   like  
**Interviewer:** Cool.   So   it   sounds   like   you   want   to   have   a   more   curated,   uh,   focus   group   and   you   also   want   to   have   a   more   public,   um,   beta   program.   Is   that   right?   Okay.   Um,   is   there   anything   else   that   you   wanted   to   bring   up   here?   Otherwise   I,   I   might   have   like   another   follow-up   question.  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   So   I   think   there's   just   two   small   things   I,   I   added   to   a   kind   of   a   miscellaneous   bucket.   So   I'm   thinking   currently   there's   a   feature   I   know   in   Google   Maps   which   is   really   useful   if   you're   going   out   to   the   middle   of   nowhere,   which   is   downloading   an   offline   map.   But   the   way   that's   done   is   currently   just   with   like   a   circle,   you   can   just   choose   the   radius   of   what   you   want.   But   I   think   with   this   feature,   if   the   entire   kind   of   like   itinerary   is   more   or   less   planned,   it   could   be   more   specific.   So,   you   know,   if   you're   going   on   a   straight   shot,   you   don't   need   to   download   an   entire   circle,   right?   You   might   just   be   able   to   download   just   the   map   area   that   you   will   plan   to   go   on.   And   I   don't   know   if   how   much   space   is   a   consideration   these   days   given   their   app   and   advancements   in   storage   size,   but   that's   a   potential   benefit   there.   And   then   the   last   item   was   just   diving   a   bit   deeper   into   revenue   channels.   So   I   think   there's   a   great   opportunity   to   partner   with   say   like   Airbnb   even   on   how   we   can   generate   the   best   end   user   experience   for   the   entire   itinerary,   which   Airbnb   adds   the   value   of   lodging,   and   to   see   how   we   can   share,   um,   revenue   there.  
**Interviewer:** Okay.   Cool.   So   when   I'm   thinking   about   this   feature,   it's   definitely   a   big   part   of   someone's   year.   Like   you,   people   probably   only   go   on   vacation   once   or   twice   a   year,   so   this   is   a   big   part   of   their   life   that   we're   kind   of   helping,   um,   to   plan   out.   What   do   you   think   could   possibly   go   wrong   with   this,   uh,   feature?  
**Candidate:** Yeah.   So   when   thinking   through   this,   um,   top   of   mind   issues   was   firstly   if   someone   does   a   lot   of   planning   beforehand,   and   let's   just   say   that   it's   a   family   who's   going,   and   this   is   a   very   real   scenario   because   it's   happened   to   me   before,   it   would   be   that   I   am   the   trip   planner   because   I'm   the   one   that's   more   proactive   in   my   group   of   friends   or   family   and   I   plan   out   a   list   of   itineraries   even   with   backup   options   that   I   think   if   people   aren't   interested   in,   um,   these   would   be   fallback   options.   But   there's   always   a   probability,   um,   that   the   day   of,   people   aren't   just   feeling   it   and   they're   no   longer   satisfied   with   what   was   pre-planned.   And   so   this   feature   may   not   be   as   useful   in   that   case,   um,   if   it   were   just   a   single   person   planning   the   event   and   that   they   might   want   to   change   things   up   spontaneously   as   well.   So   that's   the   main   kind   of   issue   I   see   with   this.   Um,   does   that   kind   of   make   sense?   I   can   try   to   take   some   time   to   think   about   a   few   more   as   well.  
**Interviewer:** Sure,   yeah.   Let's   take   some   time   and   think   about   some.  
**Candidate:** Hmm.   So   I'm   thinking   about   this   a   bit   more.   My   mind   is   still   definitely   going   to   the   first   one   where   just   it's   not   always   possible   to   capture   for   the   spontaneity   (clears throat)   of   a   trip.   Um,   I   think   potential   other   areas   of   failure   would   be   just   if   there's   not   enough   information   or   suggestions   on   this   trip   in   that   this   might   sway   a   user   to   go   on   a   trip   that   may   not   have   been   the   best   option.   So   with-   without   this   feature,   maybe   they   would   have,   um,   just   like   asked   friends   perhaps   about   where   to   go   and   that   might   have   had   a   different   end   result   where   they   ended   up   going   on   a   trip   together   or   something   of   that   such.   But   I   think   the   only   main   category   I   can   think   of   still   revolves   around,   um,   kind   of   the   trip   being   suboptimal   as   opposed   to   what   otherwise   might   have   happened.   Not   sure   if   that   entirely   makes   sense,   but   this   was   tough   for   me   to   think   about.  
**Interviewer:** Cool.   Cool.   Um,   so   let's   take   some   time   now   and   think   about   some   metrics   so,   so   that   you   know   this   is   successful.
**Candidate:** Awesome.   So   I   think   the,   the   two   main   metrics   I   wanna   track   here   are   simply   around   kind   of   adoption   and   then   retention.   And   so   the   two   metrics   here   would   just   be   the   number   of   users   who   have   created   a   trip   f-   using   this   tab,   and   the   other   metric   would   be   how   many   users   make   a   second   trip,   um,   on   this   tab.   And   so   I   think   the   first   one   will   really   help   track   to   see   if   people   are   interested   in   this   idea,   to   see   if   there's   even   a   problem   here   at   all   to   solve,   and   then   the   second   one   would   better   track   to   see   if   we've   adequately   solved   that   problem.   And   so   if   we   see,   for   example,   a   large   number   of   users   creating   a   trip   but   they   don't   come   back   for   a   second   one,   then   we   might   know   that   we're   onto   something   and   we   just   need   to   do   more   user   research   and   tweak   what   our   product   offering.   Whereas   if   no   one   is   creating   the   trip   to   begin   with,   we   might   want   to   dive   deeper   on   the   offering   entirely   to   see   if   this   is   worth   pursuing   further.   And   one   follow-up   kind   of   intermediate   metric   I   would   track   is   the   number   of   users   who   planned   a   trip   and   actually   followed   through   with   the   trip.   And   so   kinda   in   that   two-stage   process   we   talked   about   earlier   with   planning   and   actually   going   through,   we   can   use   location   data   and   to   see   if   they   actually   checked   in   to   the   hotel   or   the   restaurants   that   they   had   planned   beforehand   to   see   what   that   looks   like.   And   the   other   ther-   other   secondary   metric   would   be   kind   of   satisfaction   with   the   trip,   and   so   kind   of,   kind   of   just   a   sentiment   analysis   on   how   was   your   overall   satisfaction   of   your   trip.   Um,   and   then   that   might   be...   The   overall   trip   itinerary   might   be   posted   to   Google   Photos,   social   media,   and   then   to   see   what   engagement   users   might   go   on   top   of   that   to   make   this   more   of,   like,   a   social   environment.   (clears throat Awesome. Cool. So I think this wraps up our interview. Um, I think we're ready for some feedback now. This was a great answer. Um, uh, it's really awesome hearing your creative thoughts here. I'm curious what sort of feedback you might give yourself at this point. Great. Well, I think the, the clearest one is that when you asked me about potential areas of failure, I think for some reason my mind just got stuck on that single pain point and I wasn't able to kind of take a step back and think about more general items. So now thinking about it in hindsight, even now I'm like, oh, you know, there could have been some, like, guardrail metrics such as, is this cannibalizing engagement from the Explore tab? Um, just different types of risks that might be introduced with the feature outside of it itself. Um, aside from that, I think I tried to articulate my answers in a few different types of buckets. I don't know that they were clearly communicated across. So for example, in the Trips tab, I had the high-level when and where, the specifics like the restaurants, the hotels, and so I might have been able to do a better job on bucketing those types of categories and things that might have bade a... made a bit more sense and clearer to communicate across. (clears throat)  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   I   really   liked   how   you   picked   the   vacationer   use   case.   I   think   that   this   is   a   pretty   underserved,   uh,   use   case   in   Maps   since   Maps   is   pretty   robust   when   it   comes   to   short   trips.   But   long   trips,   there's   certainly   an   opportunity   here,   and   you   correctly   identified   that.   Um,   I   like   how   you   had   this   one   solution   and   you   went   pretty   deep   with   it   and   you   had   these   different,   um,   buckets   where   you   talked   about   the   destination   and   the   specific   activities   and   the   offline   maps.   I   think   when   it   comes   to   risks,   one   that   came   to   mind   when   I   thought   of   the   offline   maps   idea   is   that   I   think   the   offline   maps   as   is,   the   reason   that   the   circle   is   so   big   is   to   plan   for   maybe   they   have   roadblocks   and   they   have   to   take   a   s-   uh,   a   separate   route.   So   that's,   that's   probably   why.   If   they   don't   have   the   offline   maps   of   nearby,   uh,   streets,   then   they're   probably   screwed   'cause   they-   they're   not   used   to,   uh,   the   map.  
**Candidate:** Yep,   totally.   I   think   that's   an   area   I   could   have   elaborated   a   bit   more,   but   that's   a   good   call-out.  
**Interviewer:** Great.   Um,   and,   uh,   one   thing   that   I   would   add   is   that   I   think   when   you're   doing   the   focus   groups,   I   would   specify,   and   maybe   you   had   this   in   your   mind,   but   it   might   be   good   to   specify   that   you   might   want   to   do   a   curated   focus   group   just   as   a   step   one   and   then   do   the   beta   program   that's   public   as   a   step   two,   as,   as   opposed   to   doing   them   at   the   same   time,   just   so   that,   uh,   you're,   you're   able   to   iterate,   uh,   better.  
**Candidate:** Awesome.   Yeah,   that   makes   sense,   to   have   a   clear   focus   at   each   step.  
**Interviewer:** Yeah,   and   I,   I   think   that   it   would   be   also   good   to   kind   of   state,   like,   what   your   V2   version   of   the,   um,   feature   might   be,   and   I...   You,   you,   you,   you   kinda   did   get   at   this.   Um,   you   talked   about   how   it   would   be   good   to   think   about   monetization   ideas   and   partnering   with   hotels.   But   to   me,   I   think   this   is   more   of   a   V2   idea   since   in   the   beginning   you   stated   that   you   wanted   to   focus   on   engagement.  
**Candidate:** Yep,   absolutely.  
**Interviewer:** Um,   all   in   all,   this   was   a   great   answer.   I   don't   think   I   have   anything   else.   Um,   thanks,   Nathan,   for   your   time.   And   for   the   viewers,   good   luck   with   your   upcoming   PM   interview.
