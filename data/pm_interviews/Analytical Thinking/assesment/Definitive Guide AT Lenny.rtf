\
Analytical Thinking (AT) interviews assess a candidate's ability to establish metrics, set goals, and evaluate tradeoffs for products. A typical AT interview lasts 45 minutes, with approximately 35 minutes of actual working time after accounting for introductions and wrap-up questions.\
\
Unlike Product Sense interviews where you might take up 90% of the talking time, Analytical Thinking interviews are more interactive with approximately 80% candidate talking time. You can expect more back-and-forth dialogue, especially during metric discussions and trade-off questions.\
\
Before diving into the four key sections, begin with a structured opening:\
\
**Start with assumptions and a clear framework:** After stating relevant assumptions (e.g., geographic focus, platform), outline your planned approach:\
\
*"I want to start by reviewing the product's landscape and reason for existing, then identify key stakeholders and metrics, define a North Star metric with guardrails, and finally set specific team goals and discuss any tradeoffs. Does that sound like a good plan?"*\
\
This establishes structure and gives the interviewer a chance to provide initial feedback. Now, let's explore each section in detail:\
\
## 1. Product Rationale (~5 minutes)\
\
**Purpose:** Establish your understanding of the product context and its strategic importance.\
\
**Key Components:**\
- Describe the product, key use cases, maturity level, and business model\
- Explain why the product matters to users and the company\
- Review alternatives/competitors and their limitations\
- Highlight the company's unique positioning\
- Define a placeholder mission statement for the product\
- For products within a larger company, also articulate the parent company's mission statement (this will be valuable for later trade-off decisions)\
\
**Execution Tips:**\
- Don't rely on insider knowledge - explain your reasoning from first principles\
- Take 1-2 minutes to structure your thoughts before sharing\
- Focus on framing the product in its industry context and lifecycle stage\
- Create a clear mission statement that can guide later decisions\
- Check for interviewer agreement before moving to the next section\
- State why the company specifically cares about this product (business rationale)\
- If you realize you've overlooked an important aspect (like a key revenue stream), briefly acknowledge it and address it without disrupting your flow\
- If you're unfamiliar with a product, acknowledge it upfront and ask for clarification on key functionality without asking to be "spoon-fed" the entire analysis\
- Great candidates make the interviewer "feel something" about why the world needs this product, contrasting the world with and without it\
- Establish a clear through-line from the company's mission down to the specific product\
- When interviewing with a company, review their portfolio of high-level products beforehand (spend at least 20 minutes understanding each major product, including its purpose, history, business model, and alignment with company mission)\
\
## 2. Measuring Impact (~15 minutes)\
\
**Purpose:** Develop a comprehensive measurement framework that captures value creation across the ecosystem.\
\
**Key Components:**\
- Identify main ecosystem players and their value propositions\
- List key actions each player takes to derive value\
- Package these actions into metrics with appropriate timeframes\
- Select a north star metric (NSM) that captures value across players\
- Critique your NSM by acknowledging its strengths and weaknesses\
- Define guardrail metrics to counterbalance the NSM's drawbacks\
\
**Execution Tips:**\
- Take brief "heads down" time (2-3 minutes) at each transition point to collect your thoughts\
- Consider muting yourself during these thinking periods\
- Avoid vague terms like "engagement" or vanity metrics like "installs"\
- Pair each metric with a specific timeframe (daily, weekly, monthly)\
- Have clear rationale for why you chose specific timeframes based on user activity frequency\
- Be prepared to defend your timeframe choices if challenged (e.g., why weekly vs. monthly)\
- Ensure counter metrics actually balance the NSM and remain healthy as it grows\
- Take a pause to think through your metric framework before presenting\
- Be specific about what each metric measures and why it matters\
- Connect metrics directly to value creation for each ecosystem player\
- Keep ecosystem player categories focused on the most important buckets rather than being exhaustively comprehensive\
- Avoid "vanity metrics" that don't provide ongoing signal about ecosystem health (like cumulative totals over all time)\
- Use averages cautiously - they're useful for ecosystem health metrics but problematic as North Star metrics\
- Check in with the interviewer after identifying ecosystem players to ensure you haven't missed important ones\
- Be specific with metric definitions - "how much people listen" is not a metric, "number of users who listen to at least one song per day" is\
- Be extremely specific about how you would calculate each metric (e.g., "I would count the number of new listings published and approved on the marketplace per week")\
- Frame your metrics so they could be visualized (think: "Could this be a line or bar chart on a dashboard?")\
- Consider using the metaphor of an "executive dashboard" with limited screen space to focus your metrics\
- Focus on primary metrics and avoid discussing secondary metrics - if it's not a primary metric, don't waste time discussing it in the interview\
\
**Key Actions Identification:**\
- Focus on actions that are absolutely necessary to get value, not nice-to-have actions  \
- Ask yourself: "What does this ecosystem player HAVE to do to get value?"\
- Identify the actions without which the ecosystem player cannot realize their value proposition\
\
**Framework for Ecosystem Health Metrics:**\
1. For each key action that represents value creation:\
   - Count the number of unique users who perform the action (within a timeframe)\
   - Count the total number of times the action occurs (within the same timeframe)\
   - Consider adding a depth/quality metric if relevant (e.g., total minutes of content viewed)\
2. Apply appropriate timeframes based on:\
   - Typical usage patterns (how often users engage with the product)\
   - The scale at which the product operates\
   - How quickly you need signals about ecosystem health\
   - Daily: For high-frequency actions or when immediate signals are needed\
   - Weekly: For moderate-frequency actions (often a good default choice)\
   - Monthly: For less frequent but significant actions\
3. Stick primarily with raw counts for ecosystem health metrics, not percentages or ratios\
4. Be able to articulate your metrics in mathematical form (e.g., with numerators and denominators where applicable)\
\
**Timeframe Selection Best Practices:**\
- Consider the natural usage patterns of the product (if users typically engage with the product daily, daily metrics make sense)\
- Daily metrics may show higher volatility (like an EKG), while weekly and monthly metrics will be smoother\
- Consider the signal volatility you're willing to accept (daily metrics for enterprise products might show dramatic weekday/weekend patterns)\
- When uncertain about the best timeframe, you can state that you'd track metrics at multiple frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly) but focus on the one that provides the highest signal\
\
**North Star Metrics Best Practices:**\
- Choose metrics that can grow continuously as the product succeeds\
- Raw counts usually work better than percentages or averages\
- The metric should represent ultimate value creation for multiple ecosystem players\
- It should be something that can only go up if the product is truly succeeding\
- When selecting a timeframe, consider how quickly you need to see signals and what represents a meaningful period for your product\
- Avoid using averages or medians as North Star metrics - they can be misleading when ecosystem size changes\
- If none of your ecosystem health metrics works well as a North Star, consider creating a new metric that captures value for multiple ecosystem players\
- Avoid metrics that have an asymptote (like percentages that max out at 100%)\
- Choose metrics that can grow indefinitely as the product succeeds\
- Be cautious with percentages as North Star metrics since they may stay flat or even improve while the ecosystem is declining (the ratio/percent can increase while the overall ecosystem gets smaller)\
- Instead of using generic terms like "daily active users," be specific about what defines "active" (e.g., "number of creators who post at least one reel per day")\
- For marketplace products, ensure your North Star captures value for both sides (e.g., "completed rides per week" for a ride-sharing app)\
\
**Guardrail Metrics Best Practices:**\
- Unlike North Star metrics, percentages often work better than raw counts for guardrails\
- This is because raw counts of negative events may increase with scale even if the ecosystem is healthy\
- For example, use "% of transactions resulting in disputes" rather than "total number of disputes"\
- Guardrails should directly address the main drawbacks of your North Star metric\
- Focus on 2-3 guardrails that represent the most critical health checks\
- A good test: "I want to see my North Star metric go up and to the right as long as my guardrail metrics stay within some kind of healthy range"\
- Consider moving percentages, ratios, and averages to your guardrail metrics rather than using them as primary ecosystem health metrics\
\
**Common Pitfalls in Measuring Ecosystem Health:**\
- **Unclear metric definitions**: Avoid describing metrics casually like "I'd measure engagement" - if you can't describe it to a data scientist in a way they could run a query against, it's not a good metric\
- **Too many metrics**: Focus on 3-5 key metrics per ecosystem player rather than trying to be exhaustive, prioritizing those that directly tie to value creation\
- **Using percentages and ratios as NSM**: Your North Star Metric should be able to grow infinitely, while percentages have natural ceilings\
- **Skipping guardrails**: Don't focus only on growth without considering sustainability - proactively identify specific risks that need monitoring\
\
## 3. Setting Goals (~5 minutes)\
\
**Purpose:** Make an "altitude shift" from company/product goals to specific team-level goals.\
\
**Key Components:**\
- Focus on one ecosystem player who can drive the most growth\
- Work backward from key actions to identify leading metrics\
- Map the entire journey that leads to the key actions contributing to your North Star Metric\
- Propose 1-3 specific goals for the next 3-6 months\
- Prioritize one goal based on impact and feasibility\
\
**Execution Tips:**\
- Make a clear "altitude shift" from product-level metrics (50,000-foot view) to team-level goals\
- Justify why you selected a particular ecosystem player to focus on\
- Ensure goals are directly actionable by a single product team\
- Score potential goals on both feasibility (ability to influence) and impact\
- Keep the timeframe realistic (3-6 months) for a product team\
- Connect your chosen goal back to the North Star metric and product mission\
- Take a brief pause to organize your thoughts before presenting goals\
- If you've forgotten to mention something relevant to goals, it's usually better to address it now rather than backtracking later in the interview\
- Check in with interviewer after completing countermetrics before moving to goals: "Next, I'd be happy to go into how I would translate these into goals that my team could focus on over the next three to six months, or I'd be happy to go anywhere else with the interview that you're interested in."\
- Be decisive when selecting a goal - waffling or trying to focus on multiple goals simultaneously is often viewed negatively\
- Consider the product's lifecycle stage when setting goals (e.g., for new marketplaces, focus on supply first)\
- Frame your goal selection in terms of what would have the biggest leverage for moving your North Star metric\
- Avoid goals that could be achieved through undesirable behavior or that compete with other ecosystem metrics\
- Avoid goals that require too many other teams' involvement or take too long to show meaningful change\
\
**Organizational Considerations for Goal Feasibility:**\
- When evaluating "ability to influence" in team goals prioritization, consider not just technical complexity but also organizational boundaries\
- Goals requiring changes to product areas owned by other PMs will have lower "ability to influence" scores\
- Distinguish between goals your team can directly influence versus those requiring cross-team collaboration\
- Be realistic about your sphere of influence (e.g., a Marketplace PM would have limited ability to influence Newsfeed algorithm changes)\
- Consider the political capital and relationship-building required for goals that depend on other teams' priorities\
\
## 4. Evaluating Tradeoffs (~10 minutes)\
\
**Purpose:** Demonstrate your ability to make principled decisions when faced with competing options.\
\
**Key Components:**\
- Identify the type of tradeoff (breadth vs. depth, real estate decisions, required vs. optional features, etc.)\
- Clarify the common goal shared by both options\
- Frame the tradeoff by outlining pros and cons of each option\
- Summarize the fundamental tradeoff (e.g., "discovery potential vs. conversion likelihood")\
- Make a decisive recommendation with clear rationale\
- Specify what would need to be true for you to change your stance\
\
**Types of Tradeoff Questions:**\
1. **Breadth vs. Depth**\
   - Example: "Would you rather have 100 reels with 1 million views or 1 million reels with 100 views?"\
   - Example: "Should we show recommendations from different categories or more items in the same category?"\
\
2. **Real Estate Prioritization**\
   - Example: "Should we put Reels at the top of Instagram instead of Stories?"\
   - Example: "Which feature deserves the most prominent placement in the UI?"\
\
3. **Required vs. Optional Features**\
   - Example: "Should profile photo upload be required during signup or optional?"\
   - Example: "Should we remove this step from the onboarding flow?"\
\
4. **Ship or Don't Ship**\
   - Example: "We shipped a test to 10% of users that reduces comments but increases reactions... should we roll it out to all users?"\
\
5. **Kill a Feature or Keep It**\
   - Example: "Should we remove this feature that has low usage but high satisfaction among the small group who use it?"\
\
**Execution Tips:**\
- Connect your decision back to the product mission and company strategy\
- Consider the product's lifecycle stage when making recommendations\
- Be decisive - don't hedge or avoid making a clear recommendation\
- Always include "what would need to be true for me to change my opinion"\
- Convert "apples-to-oranges" comparisons into "apples-to-apples" by finding common objectives\
- For feature placement tradeoffs, consider both user experience and business strategy\
- For breadth vs. depth questions, analyze which approach better serves the core mission\
- Be prepared for tradeoff questions at any point in the interview, including at the beginning\
- If a tradeoff scenario would trigger one of your guardrail metrics, be very cautious about recommending that option\
- Use the product mission statement as an anchor for your recommendation to show consistency in your thinking\
- Note: If you finish the interview without being asked a tradeoff question, this might be a sign the interview didn't go well\
- When facing decisions with incomplete data, don't just say "I would run a test" without making a decision\
- Instead, state your assumptions, describe how you'd design the test, and specify what decisions you'd make based on different potential outcomes\
- Always tie your trade-off decision back to what you've already discussed (mission, metrics, goals)\
- Consider the current user base and context (e.g., for Facebook, consider who's signing up today - developing markets, older users, etc.)\
- Avoid indecisiveness by deferring to others (e.g., "I'd work with my UX researcher to see which one people like better")\
\
**Framework for Making Decisions:**\
When evaluating options in a trade-off, systematically check if:\
1. Both options align with the product and company mission (if neither fails the mission test, this won't be a tiebreaker)\
2. Both would contribute to the North Star metric if successful\
3. The chosen option aligns with your prioritized goals\
4. The chosen option doesn't trigger any guardrail metrics\
\
**Common Pitfalls in Evaluating Tradeoffs:**\
- **Weak strategic alignment**: Always refer back to the company and product mission when making tradeoff decisions\
- **Indecisiveness**: Make clear decisions with explicit rationale rather than deferring to others\
\
## Common Question Types & Practice Framework\
\
**Common Question Types:**\
1. **Setting a goal for a product**\
   - Example: "Set a goal for Spotify" or "measure success for Spotify"\
2. **Making a tradeoff**\
   - Example: "How would you decide between increasing reactions/item on newsfeed vs. increasing number of items viewed in newsfeed?"\
3. **Debugging / root cause** (less common and being phased out)\
   - Example: "You're a PM at DoorDash and noticed orders were down 10% last week. What happened?"\
4. **Estimation questions** (primarily at Google, not Meta)\
   - Example: "How many shuttle buses do you need to ferry Googlers to Mountain View from San Francisco?"\
   - Example: "How many hours do Americans spend stopped at traffic lights each year?"\
\
**Estimation Question Tips:**\
- For Google interviews, expect to spend about 10 minutes on an estimation question\
- Break the problem into smaller components (top-down approach)\
- State your assumptions clearly\
- Show your reasoning for each step\
- Focus on the approach rather than the exact answer\
- Be prepared to defend your assumptions if challenged\
\
**Practice Framework:**\
1. Master the structured template approach\
2. Practice with real interview questions\
3. Develop clear frameworks for identifying ecosystem players and metrics\
4. Learn to make decisive tradeoff decisions with solid rationale\
5. Focus on providing clear signals rather than perfect answers\
\
**Product Archetypes Approach to Preparation:**\
- Instead of memorizing metrics for every product, learn the frameworks for key product archetypes:\
  - Messaging products (WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram DM)\
  - Feed/Stream products (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)\
  - Marketplace products (Uber, Airbnb, Facebook Marketplace)\
  - Streaming products (Netflix, YouTube, Facebook Live)\
  - Notification systems (notification bells across platforms)\
- If you understand one product within an archetype well, you can apply similar thinking to others in that category\
- For example, if you've prepared to talk about a marketplace product like Airbnb, you'll also be prepared for Uber and Doordash since they're very similar marketplace products at their core (with Airbnb hosts = Uber drivers = Doordash restaurants, and Airbnb guests = Uber riders = Doordash customers)\
- Use AI tools to analyze question banks and identify common product archetypes that appear in interviews\
- For marketplace products, recognize that roles may change but the structure is similar (e.g., Uber drivers = Airbnb hosts, Uber riders = Airbnb guests)\
\
**Differences Between Companies' Analytical Thinking Interviews:**\
- The core framework applies across companies (Meta, Google, etc.)\
- Google interviews may:\
  - Place less emphasis on trade-off questions\
  - Focus more on the ecosystem than the specific product\
  - Place greater emphasis on business activity/monetary impact in their interviews\
  - Include estimation questions more frequently\
- The fundamental signals interviewers look for remain similar across companies\
\
**General Interview Approach:**\
- Own the interview structure: Treat this as a meeting you're driving\
- Embrace strategic pauses: Take 1-2 minute pauses at transition points\
- Avoid thinking aloud: It can only hurt you by exposing unpolished thoughts\
- Don't share your screen: This prevents distractions and maintains focus\
- Respond to "nudges": Interviewers may guide you toward signals they're seeking\
- It's okay to backtrack: If you realize a mistake, correct your path thoughtfully\
- Reserve approximately 10 minutes for tradeoff discussions\
- Be ruthless with time management - aim for satisfactory answers across all dimensions rather than perfection in one area\
- Check in with the interviewer before moving to new sections with phrases like "Does that sound okay to you?"\
- Ask about the interview structure upfront if the interviewer doesn't provide it\
\
**Talk Track Best Practices:**\
- After stating assumptions and game plan, take 2-3 minutes of "heads down time" to organize your thoughts\
- Consider muting yourself during heads-down work\
- For ecosystem players analysis, list the players first, then go row by row (value props, key actions, metrics)\
- Keep descriptions succinct - let the interviewer ask for more detail if needed\
- For unfamiliar products, acknowledge limitations upfront and ask for clarification on key functionality\
\
**What separates good from great answers:**\
- The clarity of your thought process and articulation of rationale\
- Proactively structuring the conversation without waiting for the interviewer to guide you\
- Demonstrating holistic thinking across all components (not just excelling in one area)\
- Making decisive recommendations while acknowledging what would change your mind\
- Connecting each section back to your product mission statement and core value creation\
- Creating a clear through-line from company mission to specific metrics and recommendations\
- Making the interviewer "feel something" about why the product matters\
- Being specific and precise when defining metrics\
- The ability to perform an "altitude shift" - moving from high-level company vision down to specific team-level goals\
\
**Common Misconceptions and Preparation Pitfalls:**\
- There is no "right answer" - interviewers assess your reasoning process, not a specific outcome\
- Overpreparing by memorizing "correct" metrics for different companies can lead to insufficient first-principles reasoning\
- Don't burn yourself out with too many mock interviews - ensure you have energy for the actual interview\
- Avoid getting mired in excessive detail or proposing too many metrics\
- Focus on a cohesive set of 3-5 metrics rather than trying to be comprehensive\
- In a real-world desert island scenario, you might only have two metrics: North Star and countermetric}
