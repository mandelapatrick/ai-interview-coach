    additionalInfo: "Revenue: $12B (flat YoY). Passengers: 45M annually. Load factor: 82%. Fuel costs: up 25% ($3B total). Labor costs: up 15% ($2.5B total). Aircraft utilization: down 10%. Ancillary revenue: $800M (down from $1.1B). Competitors have maintained margins.",
    solution: "Root cause: Fuel cost increase (+$600M) and ancillary revenue decline (-$300M) account for $900M profit drop. Recommendation: (1) Hedge fuel costs, (2) Revamp ancillary strategy (baggage, seat selection, partnerships), (3) Optimize routes to improve aircraft utilization.

Rationale: Strategic fit for digital transformation, AI capabilities accelerate drug development. Synergies: $100M+ revenue potential through PharmaCo channels.

    solution: "Root cause: Poor demand forecasting + suboptimal replenishment frequency. Recommendations: (1) Implement AI-based demand forecasting (reduce forecast error from 25% to 10%), (2) Increase perishables ordering to daily for high-volume stores, (3) Dynamic markdowns for approaching-expiry items, (4) Cross-dock fresh produce to reduce DC dwell time.

Manufacturing: Would need to set up local facility (Make in India policy).",
    solution: "Recommendation: Enter, but focus on mid-segment ($150-300) with audio differentiation. Rationale: Leverage brand strength in audio, avoid crowded budget segment. Strategy: (1) Partner with Foxconn for manufacturing initially, (2) Lead with 'best audio smartphone' positioning, (3) Bundle with TechGiant earbuds for ecosystem play. Investment: $200M over 2 years. Target: 3% market share in mid-segment by Year 2 = 1.5M units. Key risk: Established competition, need strong distribution partnerships.",

BurgerKing food costs: 32% (vs competitor 28%). Loyalty program: 2M members (competitor has 8M). Marketing budget available: $50M for response campaign.",
    solution: "Response strategy (30-day sprint): (1) Launch '2 for $6' value bundle targeting lost customers (not full $5 menu - margin protection), (2) Activate loyalty members with exclusive $4 offer to drive traffic, (3) Aggressive digital marketing highlighting flame-grilled quality difference. Medium-term (90 days): (4) Renegotiate supplier contracts to improve food costs, (5) Expand loyalty program with sign-up bonus. Avoid: Price war on full menu.

Spa/wellness: underutilized (30% capacity). Corporate vs leisure mix: 60/40 (was 40/60). New competitor: Airbnb Luxe taking 5% of leisure market.",
    solution: "Diagnosis: Margin compression from (1) ADR erosion due to corporate negotiated rates, (2) Labor cost inflation, (3) Underutilized amenities. Recommendations: (1) Yield management - reduce corporate allocation during peak periods to capture higher leisure rates, (2) Reimagine F&B - convert underperforming restaurant to grab-and-go + delivery kitchen, (3) Launch wellness packages to drive spa utilization (target 60%), (4) Automate check-in/concierge for labor efficiency.

In the last two to three years, they've seen a decline in profits, whereas the rest of the industry has experienced healthy growth. They've come to us to identify the root cause of this issue and how they can reverse it.",
    additionalInfo: "The client sells other products, but the focus today is only on their cookie segment. The scope is limited to the United States market. The case involves analysis of revenues and costs, with particular focus on cost structure including ingredients, manufacturing, warehousing, packaging, and distribution. The time period covers 2020-2022, which includes pandemic and macroeconomic factors affecting distribution costs and supply chains.",
    solution: "The root cause of Cookie Co's profitability decline is rising distribution and supply chain costs that have affected them more significantly than competitors. During 2020-2022, the macroeconomic environment (pandemic, supply chain disruptions) led to increased distribution costs. While these costs affected the entire industry, Cookie Co was disproportionately impacted. The solution involves: 1) Identifying specific cost drivers in the distribution and supply chain, 2) Implementing cost control measures for distribution and warehousing, 3) Evaluating packaging efficiency, 4) Benchmarking against competitors to understand why they managed costs better, and 5) Considering strategic alternatives for distribution network optimization. Strong performance indicators: Correctly identifies profitability as revenue minus costs framework, develops hypothesis that costs are the issue given market growth context, systematically walks through cost structure chronologically, connects macroeconomic context to distribution cost increases, recognizes industry-wide vs company-specific cost factors.",

White space analysis: 400 potential new locations identified. Competition: Equinox (premium), Planet Fitness (budget), boutiques (SoulCycle, etc.). Industry trend: Hybrid (digital + physical) growing.",
    solution: "Recommendation: Proceed with caution, negotiate to $400-450M (8-9x EBITDA). Concerns: (1) High churn rate (25% vs industry 20%), (2) Expansion assumes 300 new studios - execution risk, (3) Digital disruption (Peloton effect).

    solution: "Diagnosis: CAC payback too long (20 months) due to inefficient SMB sales motion. Path to profitability: (1) Shift mix to Enterprise (lower churn, higher LTV) - target 50/50 by Year 2, (2) Implement product-led growth for SMB (self-serve, reduce sales touch), (3) Reduce S&M to 45% of revenue through efficiency, (4) Maintain R&D but focus on enterprise features.

    additionalInfo: "Pre-transformation: $10B revenue, 8% margin. Current: $11B revenue, 7.3% margin. E-commerce: grew from 10% to 25% of revenue. Store traffic: down 20%. Store count: unchanged (500 stores). E-commerce margin: 5% (vs store margin 10%). Fulfillment costs: up 150%. Returns rate online: 25% (vs 8% in-store). Marketing spend: up 40% (digital ads).",
    solution: "Diagnosis: Channel mix shift destroying margins - e-commerce growth is dilutive at 5% margin. Root causes: (1) High fulfillment costs (ship-from-store inefficient), (2) Returns killing e-commerce profitability, (3) Store network not optimized for omnichannel. Recommendations: (1) Optimize fulfillment - build 3 regional DCs, reduce ship-from-store (save $50M), (2) Reduce returns through better sizing/AR tools (target 15%), (3) Convert 50 underperforming stores to fulfillment hubs, (4) Implement BOPIS to drive store traffic. Path to ROI: Improve e-commerce margin to 8% within 2 years = $100M+ incremental profit.",
